enjoyed
the

enough
I
was
willing

were
zipping
around
so
absurdly
fast
that
it
broke

so
I
didnt
find
it
dramatically
satsifying
I
honestly
didnt

to
warriors
who
perform
exemplary

must

women
and

Knighthood
originated
in
Andal
culture
and
was
introduced
to
Westeros
during
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
As
a
result
of
this
knighthood
is
intimately
tied
to
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
and
the
ideal
of
knighthood
is
to
be
not
only
an
honorable
warrior
but
a
devout
follower
of
the
Seven
And
with
any
knight
honorable
conduct
and
level
of
piety
varies
from
person
to
person
The
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
the
dominant
religion
in
all
but
two
of
the
kingdoms
the
North
whose
inhabitants
still
worship
the
Old
Gods
of
the
Forest
and
the
Iron
Islands
who
follow
a
local
deity
called
the
Drowned
God
The
institution
of
knighthood
is
therefore
not
heavily
practiced
in
these
two
regions
and
very
few
Northerners
or
Ironborn
ever
choose
to
become
knights
even
if
they
are
renowned
warriors
For
example
Eddard
Stark
himself
was
not
a
knight
because
he
proudly
continued
to
worship
the
Old
Gods
of
his
ancestors
yet
he
was
still
a
great
warrior
Sometimes
however
a
soldier
who
does
not
follow
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
may
nonetheless
be
rewarded
for
exemplary
service
with
the
title
of
knighthood
by
a
lord
who
does
worship
the
Seven
Examples
areSer
Rodrik
Cassel
and
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
both
of
the
North
Because
it
is
tied
to
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
knighthood
does
not
exist
in
other
cultures
outside
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
either
among
the
wildlingsbeyond
the
Wall
nor
across
the
Narrow
Sea
in
other
continents
such
as
Essos
though
of
course
a
knight
from
the
Seven
Kingdoms
may
travel
to
the
Free
Cities

Sandor
Cleganesrc
Gregor
Clegane
is
knighted
by
Prince
Rhaegar
Targaryen
Typically
young
men
must
undergo
many
years
of
extensive
and
expensive
training
to
become
a
knight
A
young
knightintraining
is
known
as
a
Squire
Pursuing
a
knighthood
is
one
of
the
few
ways
for
a
member
of
the
smallfolk
to
achieve
rank
and
standing
amongst
the
nobility
However
such
a
task
usually
involves
the
expenditure
of
significant
sums
of
money
on
armor
and
weaponry
which
puts
it
out
of
the
reach
of
most
commoners
The
rank
of
knighthood
is
not
hereditary
and
thus
a
knights
sons
must
go
through
the
whole
process
of
becoming
knights
themselves
Of
course
a
commoner
who
has
been
knighted
will
have
greater
opportunity
to
gain
the
wealth
needed
to
put
his
sons
through
training
as
knights
It
is
not
unheard
of
however
for
commoners
to
be
knighted
after
significantly
distinguishing
themselves
in
combat
This
skips
the
typically
large
costs
of
training
to
be
a
knight
though
it
happens
more
often
in
wartime
During
Roberts
Rebellion
Stannis
Baratheon
knighted
Davos
Seaworth
as
a
reward
for
saving
his
castle
garrison
at
the
Siege
of
Storms
End
albeit
this
was
a
rare
case
in
which
Davossbravery
was
not
in
combat
but
in
running
the
blockade
around
the
castle
to
bring
food
to
the
starving
garrison
Even
a
common
sellsword
that
has
fought
valiantly
in
combat
may
be
rewarded
by
being
dubbed
a
knight
though
this
occurs
infrequently
For
example
Ser
Bronn
of
the
Blackwater
was
knighted
after
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
for
the
vital
role
he
played
in
setting
the
wildfire
trap
which
destroyed
much
of
the
attacking
enemy
fleet
Types
of
knights
In
theory
all
knights
hold
an
equal
rank
but
in
practice
knights
who
own
their
own
lands
or
who
serve
major
lords
are
much
more
highly
respected
than
a
landless
commoner
who
happened
to
be
knighted
after
fighting
valiantly
in
a
battle
It
is
also
seen
as
more
prestigious
to
be
knighted
by
a
king
a
major
lord
a
Kingsguard
or
another
highly
respected
knight
Any
knight
can
theoretically
make
another
man
a
knight
if
he
is
willing
to
say
the
vows
though
respectable
knights
would
not
hand
out
the
title
lightly
A
sellsword
might
get
knighted
for
fighting
well
in
a
battle
and
he
might
dishonorably
knight
all
of
his
drinking
companions
who
did
nothing
to
earn
it
They
would
technically
hold
the
title
of
knight
but
no
one
would
take
their
title
seriously
due
to
the
low
prestige
of
how
they
became
knighted
Most
often
young
men
who
have
finished
their
training
and
just
recently
been
knighted
are
landless
and
not
in
the
service
of
any
lord
There
are
three
stages
of
service
that
knights
hope
to
work
their
way
up
through
A
poor
hedge
knight
proverbially
camping
under
a
hedge
by
the
roadside
Hedge
knights
are
typically
commoners
who
have
risen
to
knighthood
They
have
no
fixed
abode
and
wander
the
Seven
Kingdoms
looking
for
a
cause
to
fight
for
They
are
disparagingly
called
hedge
knights
because
it
is
said
that
they
are
so
poor
that
they
just
sleep
under
hedges
by
the
side
of
the
road
as
they
wander
from
one
prospective
employer
to
the
next
They
frequently
travel
around
to
different
tournaments
to
show
off
their
prowess
in
the
hope
that
a
lord
in
attendance
will
then
hire
them
many
lords
do
use
tournaments
as
recruiting
grounds
though
how
well
an
individual
hedge
knight
performs
in
the
tournament
is
up
to
him
Many
consider
hedge
knights
to
be
not
much
better
than
sellswords
Sworn
swords
are
knights
sworn
to
a
particular
lord
Sometimes
this
is
permanent
but
mainly
it
is
temporary
with
hedge
knights
joining
a
lord
for
a
particular
purpose
and
then
being
released
from
his
service
afterwards
Landed
knights
are
knights
who
have
been
rewarded
for
their
service
by
a
lord
with
land
typically
a
smallholding
large
farm
or
small
manor
with
servants
They
form
the
minor
nobility
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Successful
landed
knights
who
expand
their
holdings
or
continue
to
perform
exemplary
service
for
their
liege
may
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
Lord
in
time
gaining
the
right
to
dispense
justice
on
his
lands
including
executions
without
consulting
a
higher
lord

Ser
Jaime
Lannistersrc
In
wartime
mounted
knights
form
the
backbone
of
major
armies
in
southern
Westeros
A
single
knight
is
an
elite
professional
soldier
with
extensive
combat
training
and
equipped
with
the
finest
weapons
and
heavy
armor
A
single
knight
even
dismounted
is
worth
several
dozen
poorly
armed
and
untrained
common
foot
soldiers
conscripted
as
feudal
levies
Knights
are
very
useful
for
carving
through
and
running
down
enemy
infantry
though
they
are
also
the
best
weapon
against
the
enemy
armys
own
mounted
knights
In
peacetime
knights
prove
their
martial
valor
through
training
and
contests
of
skill
known
as
tournamentsalthough
knighthood
is
not
always
a
formal
requirement
for
participation
in
a
tournament
The
highlight
of
tournaments
is
the
joust
in
which
mounted
knights
charge
at
each
other
each
knight
trying
to
knock
the
other
off
of
his
horse
using
a
wooden
lance
Knights
at
tournaments
frequently
fight
to
win
the
favor
of
noble
ladies
if
they
prove
victorious
While
some
knights
do
fight
for
such
romantic
reasons
others
are
more
interested
in
the
large
money
prizes
awarded
to
the
winners
often
consisting
of
several
hundred
to
several
thousand
Gold
Dragons
Others
fight
at
tournaments
to
win
general
social
prestige
or
for
the
excitement
of
victory
though
a
few
such
as
SerGregor
Clegane
fight
simply
because
they
enjoy
violence
Knights
often
formally
swear
fealty
to
lords
by
exchanging
formulaic
vows
In
one
commonly
used
formula
the
knight
kneels
before
a
lord
in
supplication
while
holding
up
his
sword
in
offering
and
they
give
the
following
exchange
Knight
I
offer
my
services
Lords
name
I
will
shield
your
back
and
keep
your
counsel
and
give
my
life
for
yours
if
need
be
I
swear
it
by
the
Old
Gods
and
the
New
Lord
And
I
vow
that
you
shall
always
have
a
place
by
my
hearth
and
meat
and
mead
at
my
table
And
I
pledge
to
ask
no
service
of
you
that
might
bring
you
dishonor
I
swear
it
by
the
Old
Gods
and
the
New
Arise
Men
who
have
been
knighted
even
those
not
originally
from
noble
Houses
gain
the
legal
right
to
display
their
own
personal
heraldry
Since
the
Targaryen
Conquest
three
hundred
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
the
sevenman
royal
bodyguard
known
as
the
Kingsguard
have
been
considered
to
be
the
pinnacle
of
knighthood
In
theory
the
Kingsguard
are
the
elite
of
the
elite
more
skilled
at
combat
and
more
honorable
and
virtuous
than
any
other
knights
in
the
entire
realm
At
times
this
ideal
has
been
matched
in
great
and
honorable
knights
such
as
the
legendary
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
Other
times
Kingsguard
members
have
been
skilled
warriors
but
behaved
controversially
such
as
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
In
the
worst
occasions
some
Kingsguard
members
were
appointed
simply
as
political
favors
and
are
neither
honorable
nor
particularly
talented
fighters
such
as
Ser
Meryn
Trant
Fighting
style
Mounted
Westerosi
knights
on
heavy
horse
typically
charge
enemy
infantry
formations
using
war
lances
Cavalry
charges
can
devastatingly
kill
a
large
number
of
infantry
drastically
out
of
proportion
to
the
number
of
cavalry
present
On
foot
the
fighting
style
of
Westerosi
knights
consists
of
powerful
slashing
attacks
and
strong
blocks
using
a
heavy
sword
alternating
with
quick
thrusting
attacks
meant
to
penetrate
armor
Westerosi
knights
wear
heavy
plate
armor
which
provides
them
excellent
protection
particularly
against
the
crude
weapons
of
basic
infantry
conscripts
albeit
at
the
cost
of
making
their
movements
relatively
slow
The
weight
of
their
armor
slows
them
down
enough
that
they
cannot
rely
on
speed
to
win
against
unarmored
opponents
though
the
armor
will
keep
them
alive
longer
than
their
opponent
thus
knights
must
rely
on
the
raw
power
of
blows
from
heavy
swords
designed
to
deal
damage
not
only
due
to
their
sharpness
but
their
sheer
weight
Broad
hacking
and
slashing
movements
are
not
merely
dramatic
but
combined
with
the
raw
weight
of
the
sword
will
drastically
increase
the
force
behind
the
impact
of
the
blow
A
lightly
armed
and
armored
opponent
may
hit
a
knight
multiple
times
but
for
little
damage
Conversely
it
may
take
a
knight
some
time
to
pin
down
an
unarmored
opponent
but
once
he
does
his
blow
will
be
absolutely
devastating
The
agility
of
a
knight
also
depends
highly
on
its
wearer
as
veteran
fighters
are
often
seen
to
be
moderately
unrestricted
by
their
armor
The
greatest
threat
to
armored
knights
is
actually
other
armored
knights
and
their
weapon
design
and
fighting
style
evolved
to
reflect
this
The
best
way
to
penetrate
through
plate
armor
is
with
a
thrusting
attack
using
a
long
heavy
sword
A
curved
blade
could
not
apply
as
much
pressure
on
a
single
point
and
a
thinner
blade
would
snap
under
so
much
pressure
For
comparison
the
Dothraki
arakh
sword
is
meant
to
be
used
by
light
cavalry
while
running
down
unarmored
infantry
thus
the
blade
has
a
curved
design
to
provide
greater
reach
in
slashing
attacks
which
can
be
made
very
rapidly
because
the
blade
itself
is
light
and
thin
The
arakh
was
not
designed
to
punch
through
plate
armor
however
and
at
this
task
it
pales
in
comparison
to
a
knights
straight
and
heavy
longsword
Thrusting
attacks
are
best
at
actually
penetrating
armor
but
the
sheer
force
behind
a
powerful
slashing
attack
is
often
still
quite
useful
against
even
an
armored
opponent
as
the
force
of
the
blow
may
stun
him
possibly
dent
his
armor
and
sometimes
outright
cleave
through
weaker
plate
armor
Sometimes
penetrating
a
high
quality
suit
of
armor
is
almost
impossible
even
with
strong
thrusts
In
this
case
impact
weapons
such
as
warhammers
or
maces
are
good
at
delivering
powerful
blows
that
can
crush
bones
without
actually
having
to
penetrate
the
armor
By
far
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
an
armored
opponent
is
to
simply
attack
the
areas
in
which
there
is
little
or
no
armor
Because
combat
between
Westerosi
knights
is
not
quite
as
fast
as
Dothraki
wielding
arakhs
or
the
Water
Dance
fighting
style
of
the
Free
Cities
which
uses
light
rapiers
it
values
not
only
quick
reflexes
but
strategy
Instead
of
rapid
attacks
meant
to
land
a
blow
before
the
opponent
can
react
a
Westerosi
knight
must
often
engage
in
an
elaborate
series
of
feints
trying
to
gradually
lure
the
opposing
knight
into
overcommitting
his
defense
to
one
side
then
landing
a
devastating
attack
on
the
other
side
Nonetheless
speed
is
still
very
much
a
factor
in
combat
between
knights
and
the
knight
who
is
both
physically
and
mentally
faster
will
emerge
victorious
No
one
fighting
style
is
universally
superior
to
another
simply
better
suited
to
different
purposes
and
the
skill
of
the
individual
is
often
the
ultimate
deciding
factor
in
combat
For
example
equipped
with
plate
armor
and
a
heavy
sword
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
was
able
to
defeat
Qotho
the
Dothraki
bloodrider
who
was
unarmored
and
wielding
an
arakh
Qotho
did
manage
to
land
a
strike
against
Jorahs
side
but
his
armor
absorbed
the
blow
as
a
slashing
attack
from
a
thin
blade
cannot
penetrate
plate
armor
Jorah
then
used
his
arm
to
pin
the
arakh
against
his
side
and
proceeded
to
land
a
killing
blow
with
his
own
sword
Similarly
Ser
Meryn
Trant
was
able
to
defeat
the
much
more
skilled
fighter
Syrio
Forel
because
his
armor
provided
him
complete
protection
from
all
the
blows
the
famed
First
Sword
of
Braavos
managed
to
land
with
his
leadfilled
wooden
sword
This
was
in
contrast
to
the
fates
of
several
Lannister
menatarms
who
have
tried
conclusion
with
Syrio
moments
earlier
and
had
their
jaws
and
knees
effortlessly
broken
because
they
had
no
armor
over
these
body
parts
Conversely
the
sellsword
Bronn
eschewed
heavy
armor
when
fighting
in
a
trial
by
combat
against
Ser
Vardis
Egen
Unlike
Qotho
Bronn
did
not
attempt
to
immediately
land
a
strike
on
his
opponent
but
focused
on
dodging
and
avoiding
Vardiss
attacks
until
the
knight
tired
himself
out
at
which
point
Bronn
moved
in
for
a
quick
incapacitating
strike

Ser
Royland
Degore
explains
his
ascension
to
knighthood
to
Lord
Rodrik
Forrestersrc
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
knighthood
is
an
institution
that
came
with
the
Andals
when
they
invaded
Westeros
some
six
thousand
years
ago
Knights
wore
armor
derived
from
iron
and
rode
horses
into
battle
using
massedformation
charges
and
lances
to
shatter
enemy
armies
The
devastating
effectiveness
of
this
tactic
permitted
the
Andals
to
conquer
most
of
Westeros
This
tactic
was
later
adopted
by
others
so
the
cavalry
of
the
North
uses
much
the
same
weapons
armor
and
tactics
as
knights
but
are
not
called
knights
due
to
their
devotion
to
another
god
In
practice
there
is
little
difference
between
knights
and
Northern
heavy
cavalry
There
are
several
types
of
knight
Hedge
knights
are
typically
commoners
who
have
risen
to
knighthood
They
have
no
fixed
abode
and
wander
the
Seven
Kingdoms
looking
for
a
cause
to
fight
for
They
are
called
hedge
knights
because
it
is
said
that
they
are
so
poor
that
they
just
sleep
under
hedges
by
the
side
of
the
road
as
they
wander
from
one
job
to
the
next
Sometimes
these
knights
turn
to
thievery
out
of
necessity
and
become
known
as
Robber
knights
Thus
it
is
said
than
hedge
and
robber
knights
are
two
faces
of
the
same
coin
Sworn
swords
are
knights
sworn
to
a
particular
lord
Sometimes
this
is
permanent
but
mainly
it
is
temporary
with
hedge
knights
joining
a
lord
for
a
particular
purpose
and
then
being
released
from
his
service
afterwards
Landed
knights
are
knights
who
have
been
rewarded
for
their
service
by
a
lord
with
land
typically
a
smallholding
large
farm
or
small
manor
with
servants
They
form
the
minor
nobility
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Successful
landed
knights
who
expand
their
holdings
or
continue
to
perform
exemplary
service
for
their
liege
may
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
Lord
in
time
leading
a
major
noble
House
Most
knights
pass
through
three
stages
to
achieve
the
rank
They
start
as
pages
young
boys
who
perform
menial
tasks
for
their
lieges
Pages
are
not
expected
to
fight
in
battle
but
some
do
regardless
They
are
given
lessons
in
riding
and
weapons
in
return
Upon
reaching
adolescence
pages
become
Squires
Their
training
intensifies
and
they
are
taught
the
full
comportment
and
responsibilities
of
knighthood
Squires
are
expected
to
fight
in
battle
and
carry
themselves
as
knights
at
all
times
even
though
they
have
not
achieved
the
rank
yet
They
finally
become
full
knights
after
they
have
proven
themselves
In
theory
any
knight
can
make
another
man
a
knight
though
in
practice
it
is
considered
more
prestigious
to
be
famous
and
respected
knights
particularly
those
actually
commanding
a
campaign
The
highest
honor
is
to
be
knighted
by
one
of
the
Kingsguard
There
have
been
times
when
landless
hedge
knights
of
no
merit
dubbed
dozens
of
their
followers
as
knights
simply
as
a
favor
but
this
is
considered
an
extremely
disreputable
practice
The
comparison
that
George
RR
Martin
has
used
is
that
being
knighted
is
similar
to
being
a
college
graduate
exactly
how
prestigious
your
degree
is
depends
on
where
you
received
it
Technically
a
student
at
Harvard
or
Oxford
and
a
student
at
a
local
community
college
are
both
college
graduates
but
there
is
a
drastic
difference
between
the
two
Analogously
it
is
more
prestigious
to
be
knighted
by
the
Kingsguard
or
a
famous
and
revered
knight
while
a
peasant
knighted
by
a
hedge
knight
of
no
fame
would
be
scoffed
at
as
not
being
a
real
knight
at
all
Thus
the
full
course
for
a
prospective
knight
is
PageSquireHedge
KnightSworn
SwordLanded
Knight
A
man
does
not
necessarily
have
to
go
through
the
first
two
steps
to
become
a
knight
if
a
commoner
has
significantly
distinguished
himself
in
combat
a
knight
may
choose
to
elevate
him
to
knighthood
Even
a
sellsword
that
has
fought
valiantly
in
combat
may
be
rewarded
by
being
dubbed
a
knight
though
this
is
uncommon
Further
a
soldier
who
is
rewarded
by
a
lord
for
valorous
service
by
being
dubbed
a
knight
might
instantly
be
taken
on
by
that
lord
as
a
sworn
sword
within
his
own
household
skipping
the
hedge
knight
step
Further
while
rare
it
is
not
unheard
of
for
a
lord
to
reward
a
common
soldier
not
only
by
dubbing
him
a
knight
but
by
at
the
same
time
giving
him
lands
instantly
elevating
him
from
a
simple
soldier
to
a
landed
knight
and
member
of
the
minor
nobility
skipping
the
steps
of
hedge
knight
or
sworn
sword
entirely
This
was
the
case
with
Ser
Davos
Seaworth
who
was
a
common
lowborn
smuggler
but
performed
such
valorous
service
running
the
blockade
around
Storms
End
to
bring
food
to
the
besieged
castles
starving
garrison
that
Stannis
Baratheon
rewarded
him
by
not
only
knighting
him
but
giving
him
lands
to
rule
Becoming
a
knight
requires
the
applicant
to
swear
an
oath
of
allegiance
and
fealty
to
the
Seven
and
to
stand
vigil
in
a
sept
for
a
night
these
tasks
need
not
be
performed
consecutively
it
is
not
uncommon
in
times
of
war
for
a
newlymade
knight
to
not
stand
his
vigil
for
weeks
or
months
There
is
no
formal
bar
against
women
becoming
knights
only
that
it
is
simply
not
done
There
is
no
official
rule
against
women
becoming
knights
because
it
makes
as
much
sense
in
their
culture
as
making
an
official
rule
forbidding
pigs
to
fly
it
is
absurd
and
simply
impossible
for
a
woman
to
be
a
knight
While
rare
female
warriors
have
served
as
pages
and
squires
Spelling
and
pronunciation
Ser
is
not
a
typo
the
title
for
knights
within
the
fictional
universe
of
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
book
series
is
spelled
Ser
with
an
e
not
as
sir
with
an
i
as
in
real
life
This
is
just
a
quirk
of
their
culture
In
A
Feast
for
Crows
however
it
is
once
misspelled
as
Sir
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and
crew
Ser
is
pronounced
SAIR
Actors
usually
say
it
very
fast
or
slur
it
so
it
sounds
very
similar
to
the
standard
sir
but
this
is
not
the
case
That
is
actor
Sean
Bean
isnt
saying
sir
with
a
Received
Pronunciation
accent
so
it
sounds
like
SAIR
the
correct
pronunciation
of
ser
actually
is
SAIR
Writer
Bryan
Cogman
clarified
that
some
pronunciations
would
differ
due
to
the
accents
and
languages
of
the
speaker
Ser
in
particular

History
Background
House
Greyjoy

of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros
Their
lands
are
the
Iron
Islands
off
the
west
coast
of
the
continent
They
rule
from
their
castle
Pyke
from
the
island
of
the
same
name
The
Iron
Islands
are
harsh
and
bleak
and
the
Greyjoys
have
traditionally
survived
by
raiding
their
neighbors
They
have
always
had
plans
to
conquer
the
mainland
The
head
of
the
house
is
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke
House
Greyjoy
boasts
descent
from
the
Grey
King
a
legendary
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
said
to
have
ruled
for
a
thousand
years
and
taken
a
mermaid
as
his
wife
Like
the
vast
majority
of
ironborn
they
worship
theDrowned
God
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
was
the
founder
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
Iron
Islands
He
led
a
rebellion
against
King
Robert
Baratheon
eight
years
before
the
events
of
the
series
begin
Balons
sons
Rodrik
and
Maron
were
killed
in
the
unsuccessful
rebellion
Balons
only
surviving
son
Theon
was
made
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
to
ensure
Balons
submission
to
King
Robert
Only
his
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
and
two
of
his
brothers
remained
on
the
Iron
Islands
after
his
defeat
At
some
point
Balon
exiled
his
younger
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
who
became
a
feared
pirate
that
terrorized
the
seas
as
far
as
from
Oldtown
in
Westeros
to
Qarth
in
Essos
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
is
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
He
lives
at
the
Stark
castle
of
Winterfell
where
he
has
a
cordial
relationship
with
his
Stark
hosts
Despite
the
respectful
treatment
accorded
by
the
Starks
Theon
is
insecure
about
his
status
as
a
ward
He
boasts
of
his
status
as
a
lord
to
Osha
a
Wildling
servant
in
the
Stark
household
but
fails
to
intimidate
her
He
later
accompanies
Neds
son
Robb
Stark
the
King
in
the
North
to
fight
in
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
and
wins
Robbs
trust
and
favor
Season
Theon
appeals
to
King
Robb
to
send
him
on
a
mission
to
negotiate
an
alliance
with
his
father
Balon
Greyjoy
reasoning
that
the
Starks
would
need
ships
to
attack
Kings
Landing
Despite
Catelyn
Starks
distrust
of
Balon
Robb
relents
and
sends
Theon
back
to
the
Iron
Islands
to
secure
help
However
Balon
has
other
ideas
and
plans
to
use
the
power
struggle
on
the
mainland
to
carve
up
a
kingdom
in
the
North
once
more
declaring
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
is
torn
between
his
birth
family
and
his
loyalty
to
the
Starks
but
ultimately
chooses
to
submit
to
his
father
Theon
decides
to
renege
his
allegiance
to
the
Starks
and
is
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Drowned
God
while
his
father
and
sister
watch
on
Balons
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
leads
a
large
force
that
attacks
Deepwood
Motte
the
seat
of
House
Glover
Meanwhile
Theon
is
made
the
commander
of
the
Sea
Bitch
Instead
of
attacking
small
fishing
villages
as
ordered
Theon
and
his
men
raid
Torrhens
Square
and
succeed
in
drawing
the
remaining
Stark
forces
away
from
Winterfell
Without
consulting
Balon
or
Yara
Theon
and
his
men
seize
Winterfell
and
capture
Neds
younger
sons
Bran
and
Rickon
Stark
Theon
also
executes
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
for
defying
him
However
the
two
Stark
boys
and
their
Direwolves
escape
with
the
help
of
Osha
and
Hodor
In
retaliation
Theon
murders
two
orphans
and
claims
them
as
Bran
and
Rickon
His
actions
have
the
effect
of
fuelling
northern
hostility
towards
the
Ironborn
invaders
Balon
and
Yara
are
furious
with
Theons
conduct
which
has
jeopardized
the
Ironborn
war
effort
Yara
leads
a
party
to
implore
her
brother
to
leave
Winterfell
Theon
refuses
and
insists
on
defending
his
prize
against
the
northerners
Unable
to
reason
with
Theon
Yara
is
forced
to
leave
him
behind
Theon
and
his
paltry
garrison
are
besieged
by
a
large
Bolton
army
led
by
Ramsay
Snow
the
bastard
son
of
Roose
Bolton
a
vassal
of
the
Starks
The
Ironborn
turn
on
Theon
and
hand
him
over
to
Ramsay
in
return
for
safe
conduct
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
flays
them
alive
The
capture
of
Theon
is
a
major
blow
to
House
Greyjoy
since
it
deprives
Balon
of
his
last
remaining
son
and
heir
to
the
Seastone
Chair
Season
Over
a
prolonged
period
Theon
Greyjoy
is
tortured
and
emasculated
by
Ramsay
Snow
Due
to
his
experiences
Theon
adopts
the
persona
Reek
and
becomes
totally
subjugated
to
Ramsay
Theon
later
issues
an
ultimatum
to
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
demanding
that
he
withdraw
his
forces
from
the
North
Ramsay
also
threatens
to
send
more
bits
of
his
son
Theon
and
to
flay
every
Ironborn
in
the
North
alive
if
his
demands
are
not
met
As
a
parting
gift
Ramsay
also
presents
Theons
severed
penis
Unwilling
to
abandon
the
strongholds
he
has
taken
Balon
rejects
Ramsays
demands
He
also
rejects
his
son
Theon
because
he
disobeyed
his
orders
and
cannot
produce
heirs
to
further
the
Greyjoy
line
Defying
her
fathers
wishes
Yara
assembles
a
team
of
Ironborn
warriors
to
rescue
her
brother
Theon
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
has
seemingly
forgotten
his
former
identity
and
embraced
the
persona
Reek
He
is
totally
subservient
to
his
master
Ramsay
Upon
returning
to
the
Dreadfort
Roose
Bolton
reprimands
his
son
Ramsay
for
torturing
and
emasculating
Theon
As
Balons
son
and
heir
he
would
have
been
a
valuable
hostage
for
him
to
trade
with
Balon
in
return
for
securing
the
withdrawal
of
Ironborn
forces
from
the
North
Later
Yara
and
her
warriors
manage
to
infiltrate
the
Dreadfort
and
reach
Theons
cell
However
fearing
that
it
is
another
trap
set
up
by
his
master
Theon
spurns
Yaras
offer
Yara
and
her
warriors
are
forced
to
flee
when
Ramsay
unleashes
his
dogs
on
them
After
reaching
their
boats
Yara
regards
her
brother
Theon
to
be
dead
Having
proven
his
loyalty
Reek
is
sent
on
a
mission
by
Ramsay
to
secure
the
surrender
of
the
Ironborn
garrison
at
Moat
Cailin
For
this
mission
Reek
has
to
pretend
to
be
Theon
Identifying
himself
as
Theon
and
Balons
last
remaining
heir
Reek
addresses
the
Ironborn
garrison
telling
them
to
surrender
in
return
for
safe
passage
Despite
being
met
by
resistance
from
the
garrison
commander
Ralf
Kenning
his
men
accept
Theons
offer
and
surrender
to
the
Boltons
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
has
them
flayed
alive
anyway
Season
In
an
attempt
to
reach
out
to
Theon
Sansa
Stark
reminds
him
of
his
real
name
and
position
as
Balons
only
surviving
son
and
heir
Ultimately
Theon
sheds
his
Reek
persona
and
helps
Sansa
to
escape
the
new
Bolton
stronghold
of
Winterfell
Season
After
being
rescued
from
Bolton
hunters
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
and
Podrick
Payne
Theon
decides
to
part
company
with
Sansa
and
her
companions
because
he
fears
retribution
from
Jon
Snow
for
his
role
in
the
disappearance
of
Bran
and
Rickon
and
the
murder
of
the
two
orphans
Theon
takes
one
horse
and
travels
towards
the

Meanwhile
the

face
another
major
setback

of
the
Five
Kings
over

returning
to
the

and
pushing
back
the

gains
Yara
Greyjoy
counsels
her
father
Balon
to
end
his
campaign
to
conquer
the
North
but
he
refuses
to
back
down
Later
that
night

is
murdered
by

her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
announces
that
a
kingsmoot
will
elect
the
new
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
finally
returns
to
Pyke
and
receives
a
cold
reception
from
his
sister
Yara
who
is
still
angry
at
him
for
spurning
her
rescue
attempt
at
the
Dreadfort
though
her
mood
picks
up
when
Theon
pledges
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
able
to
win
the
support
of
many

her
reputation
as
a
warrior
and
Theons
support
Yara
promises
to
build
a
mighty
fleet

to

him
as
ruler
of
the

to

Throne
The
Greyjoys
have
ruled
ever
since
The
Greyjoys
keep
themselves
distant
from
the
other
Great
Houses
rarely
taking
part
in
events
on
the
mainland
which
they
call
the
green
lands
and
at
various
times
even
returning
to
their
ancient
practices
of

rebelled
against
the

declaring
himself
King

belief
was
that
Robert
who
had
only
been
on
the
throne
for
five
years
did
not
command
the
total
support
of
the
nobles
due
to
his
status
as
a
usurper
and
would
not
be
able
to
rally
the
support
needed
to
crush
the
rebellion
He
was
proven
wrong
and
was
defeated
with

showing
the
location
of
the
Dreadfort
on
the
continent
of
Westeros
The
Dreadfort
is
a
castle
situated
in
the
North
It
was
the
seat
of
House
Bolton
located
on
the
banks
of
the
Weeping
Water
east
of
Winterfell
The
Dreadfort
is
illomened
as
the
stronghold
of
House
Bolton
who
are
famed
for
the
flayed
skins
of
their
enemies
often
rumored
to
have
been
kept
on
display
in
the
castle
including
those
of
several
ancient
Stark
kings
However
if
such
gruesome
trophies
ever
did
exist
they
have
long
since
been
removed
or
destroyed
Following
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
House
Bolton
has
become
extinct
leaving
the
Dreadfort
without
any
ruling
lordship
However
House
Stark
only
captured
Winterfell
from
the
Boltons
No
mention
is
made
of
the
Dreadfort
being
captured
so
it
is
possible
there
is
still
a
Bolton
garrison
holding
the
castle

rebellion

History
Background
The
Dreadfort
under
siege
House
Bolton
of
the
Dreadfort
had
a
long
history
of
dissent
and
rebellion
to
the
point
were
they
became
known
as
the
Bane
of
the
North
Season
Word
of
Winterfells
capture
by
Theon
Greyjoy
reaches
the
Dreadforts
garrison
This
news
is
then
relayed
to
Roose
Bolton
via
messenger
ravens
Season
Ramsay
Snow
assists
Theon
in
escaping
from
the
Dreadfort
After
being
betrayed
by
his
crew
and
delivered
to
Ramsay
Snow
Theon
Greyjoy
is
imprisoned
in
a
torture
chamber
at
the
Dreadfort
Over
the
course
of
several
months
he
is
subjected
to
a
number
of
horrific
tortures
both
physical
and
psychological
Season
Yara
Greyjoy
leads
an
assault
on
the
Dreadfort
to
rescue
Theon
Greyjoy
The
assault
ends
in
failure
when
Yara
and
her
fellow
ironborn
cannot
convince
Theon
now
Reek
that
they
are
his
rescue
party
Ramsay
the
Bastards
Girls
and
his
fellow
Dreadfort
menatarms
repel
the
ironborn
raiders
Following
the
Surrender
of
Moat
Cailin
the
Boltons
take
Winterfell
the
traditional
capital
of
the
North
for
their
new
seat
leaving
The
Dreadfort
in
the
hands
of
a
handful
of
Bolton
men
and
a
Castellan
Presumbly
Roose
planned
on
giving
The
Dreadfort
to
his
and
Waldas
child
while
Ramsays
child
would
get
Winterfell
Season
Following
the
deaths
of
Roose
Bolton
Walda
Bolton
and
their
newborn
child
at
the
hands
of
Ramsay
Bolton
the
Dreadfort
passed
to
Ramsay
Not
long
after
however
Ramsay
was
defeated
and
nearly
beaten
to
death
by
Jon
Snow
at
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
then
fed
to
his
own
hounds
by
his
wife
Sansa
Stark
Thus
with
House
Bolton
having
been
cast
down
and
extinguished
the
Dreadfort
has
no
current
lord
However
it
appears
that
Sansa
Stark
by
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
is
the
rightful
Lady
of
the
Dreadfort
according
to
Westerosi
law
It
is
possible
there
is
a
Bolton
garrison
stationed
at
the
Dreadfort
in
rebellion
against
House
Stark

Dreadfort
in
the
fourth
season
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Dreadfort
has
a
similar
history
of
dissent
and
rebellion
Three
centuries
after
the
founding
of
Karhold
the
Starks
finally
crushed
the
Boltons
in
a
war
that
saw
the
Dreadfort
besieged
for
two
years
The
Dreadfort
is
a
strong
fortress
with
high
walls
and
triangular
merlons
that
look
like
sharp
stone
teeth
It
has
thick
stone
walls
and
massive
towers
Its
great
hall
is
dim
and
smoky
with
rows
of
torches
grasped
by
skeletal
human
hands
jutting
from
the
walls
Long
tables
stand
before
a
dais
with
a
high
table
The
hall
has
a
vaulted
ceiling
and
wooden
rafters
turned
black

General
Author
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
the
storyline
in
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
is
partially
and
loosely
inspired
by
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
the
dynastic
conflict
that
occurred
in
England
intermittently
between
and
following
the
countrys
defeat
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
as
well
as
Maurice
Druons
novels
The
Accursed
Kings
about
the
history
of
the
French
Kings
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
Hundred
Years
War
Just
as
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
fought
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
the
conflict
in
Game
of
Thrones
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
The
technology
level
in
their
society
more
or
less
matches
late
medieval
Europe
ie
right
before
the
use
of
gunpowder
and
cannons
revolutionized
medieval
warfare
and
brought
it
into
the
Early
Modern
era
Magic
was
prevalent
in
the
world
in
the
longdistant
past
but
for
many
centuries
magical
power
has
dwindled
in
the
world
as
has
knowledge
of
its
use
While
a
handful
of
odd
cults
still
believe
in
magic
such
as
the
Alchemists
GuildandWarlocks
of
Qarth
they
can
do
little
to
substantiate
their
claims
The
general
population
considers
magic
to
have
never
existed
at
all
and
to
be
simply
mythical
a
view
promoted
by
the
Order
of
Maesters
who
champion
a
world
based
on
science
and
reason
and
scorn
the
very
idea
of
magic
The
mighty
Valyrian
Freehold
was
built
using
the
powerful
dragons
who
were
rumored
to
share
a
deep
link
with
magic
However
most
dragons
were
killed
in
the
Doom
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
before
the
narrative
of
Game
of
Thrones
begins
and
even
the
last
dragons
which
belonged
to
House
Targaryen
died
almost
two
centuries
ago
largely
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
Science
and
technology
have
not
significantly
advanced
in
the
past
several
centuries
Recorded
history
is
indeed
vastly
longer
in
the
fantasy
world
than
in
reallife
For
example
the
Valyrian
Freehold
existed
for
an
astonishing
five
thousand
years
before
its
fall
Written
history
in
Westeros
began
with
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
albeit
much
of
this
is
fragmentary
and
biased
see
main
article
Timeline
It
is
possible
that
in
earlier
ages
when
magic
was
more
prevalent
there
was
less
drive
to
innovate
new
tools
with
science
leaving
technology
levels
static
for
many
centuries
Even
so
while
the
general
rule
holds
that
gunpowder
has
not
been
discovered
there
is
not
a
oneforone
correspondence
between
the
technology
level
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
and
the
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
For
example
certain
medical
knowledge
is
much
more
advanced
and
accurate
in
Westeros
than
it
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
partially
because
certain
discoveries
in
history
have
been
accidental
ie
penicillin
not
the
culmination
of
a
long
aggregation
of
previous
discoveries
The
people
in
Westeros
and
beyond
are
also
capable
of
producing
vast
feats
of
architecture
such
as
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
without
the
use
of
magic
at
all
Martin
has
stated
that
medical
knowledge
is
officially
more
advanced
in
Westeros
than
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
I
made
a
deliberate
decision
when
the
books
began
to
have
the
maesters
and
have
Westeros
in
general
have
better
medical
knowledge
than
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
Mostly
because
I
didnt
want
everybody
dying
at
twentysix
So
it
is
generally
improved
the
maesters
have
improved
the
standard
of
hygiene
and
they
understand
certain
practices
and
they
can
do
things
better
Also
they
have
magic
While
this
might
seem
incongruent
with
the
otherwise
static
medieval
level
of
technology
in
Westeros
much
of
reallife
medical
knowledge
was
discovered
purely
through
trial
and
error
or
even
by
accident
such
as
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
The
maesters
might
not
know
the
underlying
theoretical
reasons
behind
illnesses
what
bacteria
and
viruses
are
but
they
have
accumulated
a
more
advanced
level
of
functional
medical
knowledge
for
practical
purposes
such
as
what
herb
mixtures
will
heal
infections
better
surgical
procedures
etc
Medicine

Armament
Military
technology
in
Westeros
and
Essos
is
loosely
comparable
to
the
kinds
used
during
the
reallife
Hundred
Years
War
and
War
of
the
Roses
Crossbows
are
prevalent
though
they
have
not
superseded
longbows
which
are
also
quite
common
on
the
battlefield
again
much
like
the
s
in
reallife
northwestern
Europe
Various
kinds
of
advanced
siege
weapons
such
as
catapults
are
employed
Horse
cavalry
are
widely
used
and
some
regions
of
Essos
are
known
to
use
mounted
elephants
Heavy
cavalry
using
mounted
knights
in
full
plate
armor
is
a
mainstay
of
the
battlefield
though
they
are
more
commonly
fielded
by
the
wealthier
regions
of
Westeros
ie
the
Reach
or
the
Westerlands
while
the
poorer
kingdoms
such
as
The
North
or
the
Iron
Islands
make
do
with
chain
mail
instead
of
full
plate
armor
Many
armies
frequently
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
mercenaries
Valyrian
steel
is
a
type
of
metal
forged
in
the
oncemighty
Valyrian
Freehold
used
to
make
swords
that
are
exceptionally
sharp
and
tremendously
strong
The
knowledge
of
how
to
create
Valyrian
steel
was
lost
in
the
fall
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
ago
making
the
few
surviving
Valyrian
steel
swords
incredibly
rare
and
expensive
Valyrian
steel
is
rumored
to
have
been
forged
with
the
aid
of
magic
spells
and
dragonfire
Gunpowder
does
not
exist
in
the
medieval
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
They
do
possess
Wildfire
a
highly
flammable
and
explosive
napalmlike
substance
the
Alchemists
Guild
refuses
to
divulge
how
wildfire
is
created
but
claim
that
it
is
done
with
magical
spells
a
claim
dismissed
by
others
particularly
the
maesters
Even
so
Wildfire
is
similar
to
real
life
Greek
fire
which
was
actually
used
by
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
medieval
times
and
thus
was
actually
a
technology
known
to
medieval
peoples
and
thus
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
for
a
medieval
setting
Dragons
were
of
course
used
in
warfare
but
they
are
more
of
a
magicbased
fantasy
creature
Moreover
the
last
known
dragons
in
the
world
died
out
two
hundred
years
ago
largely
due
to
many
of
them
being
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
in
which
dragons
were
used
to
kill
other
dragons
Thus
dragons
have
not
been
used
on
the
battlefield
in
two
centuries

Currency
Several
different
types
of
currency
are
used
in
the
worlds
various
economies
The
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros
have
a
uniform
system
of
coinage
based
on
the
Gold
Dragon
coin
The
different
cities
and
nations
across
the
Narrow
Sea
on
Essos
use
their
own
various
local
currencies
Books
and
writing
Different
societies
have
their
own
writing
systems
The
main
one
encountered
is
the
one
used
for
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
throughout
Westeros
The
Andals
introduced
the
first
full
writing
system
to
Westeros
the
First
Men
before
them
only
used
a
basic
rune
script
for
the
Old
Tongue
which
was
only
used
for
basic
inscriptions
on
grave
markers
etc
The
Dothraki
do
not
have
a
written
language
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
the
Valyrian
languages
in
the
Free
Cities
and
Slavers
Bay
have
their
own
glyphbased
writing
systems
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
represent
this
in
the
TV
series
The
novels
refer
to
characters
in
Westeros
using
both
parchment
made
from
animal
skins
and
paper
made
from
wood
pulp
This
is
not
incongruous
to
the
setting
paper
was
introduced
to
real
life
Western
Europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
though
it
did
not
surpass
use
of
parchment
for
many
centuries
Generally
parchment
was
still
used
for
important
documents
legal
charters
important
diplomatic
messages
etc
while
paper
was
a
cheap
less
durable
alternative
Given
that
Westeros
is
loosely
based
on
the
War
of
the
Roses
in
England
during
the
s
it
is
not
contradictory
that
their
society
uses
a
mix
of
paper
or
parchment
for
different
tasks
Paper
seems
to
be
often
used
for
more
common
tasks
the
messages
sent
via
the
raven
network
are
described
as
being
written
on
little
scrolls
of
paper
paper
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
parchment
so
it
is
probably
easier
to
roll
easier
to
fit
more
writing
on
each
roll
and
easier
for
the
birds
to
carry
More
important
handdelivered
messages
tend
to
be
written
on
parchment
particularly
royal
decrees
from
Kings
Landing
Most
if
not
all
books
are
made
out
of
parchment
not
paper
books
are
usually
commissioned
or
handcopied
and
thus
more
like
luxury
items
so
anyone
commissioning
one
will
have
it
made
of
high
quality
They
dont
have
cheap
massproduced
paper
books
No
mention
has
been
made
of
printing
press
technology
and
it
apparently
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
and
probably
not
in
Essos
either
The
printing
press
was
only
introduced
in
reallife
Medieval
Europe
in
the
mids
and
took
time
to
be
implemented
again
matching
the
general
historical
period
of
the
setting
It
is
unknown
if
other
societies
use
earlier
forms
of
printing
such
as
woodblock
printing
etc

Measurement
Measurements
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
are
given
in
imperial
measurements
As
they
are
a
medieval
society
their
systems
of
measurements
weights
and
coinage
grew
haphazardly
out
of
local
customs
instead
of
any
rational
basis
For
example
the
Wall
is
miles
long
and
feet
tall
converted
to
the
metric
system
for
the
benefit
of
some
viewers
the
Wall
is
kilometers
long
and
between
and
meters
tall
Weights
are
rarely
mentioned
in
the
TV
series
but
it
has
been
said
that
pounds
tons
and
ounces
are
used
to
measure
them
These
are
also
nonmetric
units
as
kilograms
do
not
exist
as
a
unit
in
Westeros
in
the
books
the
old
nonmetric
unit
of
stones
is
also
used
one
stone
equals
about
pounds
Smaller
distances
can
be
measured
in
yards
Animals
and
Plants
See
main
article
Animals
and
Plants
Several
notable
animal
and
plant
species
exist
in
Westeros
and
the
Known
World
Some
of
these
have
no
real
world
counterparts
but
many
are
based
on
ice
age
megafauna
which
did
exist
in
reallife
but
went
extinct
thousands
of
years
ago
On
the
whole
it
is
very
unusual
to
encounter
animals
that
are
significantly
different
than
encountered
in
reallife
medieval
Europe
and
the
Near
East
A
few
animals
have
no
oneforone
counterpart
with
real
life
ones
ie
shadowcats
are
common
animals
somewhere
in
size
between
a
cougar
and
a
tiger
but
not
exactly
like
either
In
general
however
even
direwolves
are
a
very
rare
and
unusual
animal
for
the
inhabitants
of
Westeros
to
encounter
in
keeping
with
George
RR
Martins
attempts
to
create
a
more
realistic
gritty
fantasy
world
Animals
Dragons
winged
reptiles
of
tremendous
age
and
ferocity
capable
of
breathing
fire
Originated
in
the
east
and
enslaved
by
the
Valyrians
who
used
them
to
forge
their
empire
Most
dragons
were
destroyed
in
the
Doom
four
centuries
ago
leaving
the
few
possessed
by
House
Targaryen
as
the
only
surviving
dragons
in
the
world
which
they
used
in
their
invasion
of
Westeros
The
last
Targaryen
dragons
died
over
years
ago
The
skulls
of
more
than
a
dozen
dragons
are
kept
in
the
Red
Keep
Direwolves
a
larger
cousin
of
regular
wolves
only
found
north
of
the
Wall
In
the
south
they
are
considered
nearmythical
Occasional
sightings
of
direwolves
have
been
reported
by
the
Nights
Watch
but
at
the
time
the
series
starts
there
have
been
no
confirmed
sightings
south
of
the
Wall
for
centuries
Horses
A
common
animal
bred
all
over
Westeros
commonly
used
as
methods
of
transport
Krakens
massive
cephalopods
that
stalk
the
worlds
oceans
So
rare
that
they
are
largely
held
to
be
mythical
though

occasionally
report
seeing

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
is
a

exiled
Northern
lord
from
Westeros
previously
living
in
Essos
He
has
sworn
fealty
to
his
fellow
exile
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
was
the
first
to
help
her
adapt
to
life
as
a
Khaleesi
of
the
Dothraki

working
as

He
develops
strong
and
unrequited
feelings
for

History
Background
Jorah
fighting
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
Jorah
Mormont
is
the
son
of
Jeor
Mormont
of
House
Mormont
the
Lords
of
Bear
Island
and
vassals
of
House
Stark
in
the
North
Jorah
had
a
distinguished
early
career
and
participating
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
during
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
for
which
he
was
knighted
by
King
Robert
Baratheon
His
father
later
voluntarily
joined
the
Nights
Watch
leaving
Jorah
as
Lord
of
Bear
Island
and
head
of
House
Mormont
Jorah
married
Lynesse
Hightower
but
his
new
wife
had
expensive
tastes
that
Jorah
struggled
to
fund
Ultimately
he
resorted
to
selling
poachers
into
slavery
which
has
been
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
millennia
and
is
a
great
taboo
throughout
Westeros
Jorah
was
caught
and
disgraced
He
was
stripped
of
his
Lordship
and
fled
to
the
Free
Cities
to
avoid
being
executed
by
Eddard
Stark
though
he
left
his
familys
ancestral
sword
Longclaw
behind
his
father
would
eventually
pass
it
on
to
Jon
Snow
He
served
in
mercenary
companies
such
as
the
Golden
Company
His
wife
eventually
left
him
for
another
richer
man
He
is
called
Jorah
the
Andal
by
the
Dothraki
as
they
assume
that
all
people
from
Westeros
are
Andals
However
Jorah
is
actually
a
Northman
descended
from
the
First
Men
Besides
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros
Ser
Jorah
is
fluent
in
the
Dothraki
language
Season
Daenerys
and
Jorah
Mormont
in
the
Dothraki
sea
Jorah
appears
at
the
wedding
of
Khal
Drogo
and
Daenerys
Targaryen
He
introduces
himself
and
presents
Daenerys
with
some
books
containing
songs
and
stories
from
Westeros
He
tells
her
that
he
served
her
father
for
many
years
and
pledges
to
serve
the
rightful
king
her
brother
Viserys
While
traveling
to
Vaes
Dothrak
Ser
Jorah
tells
Viserys
that
he
lost
his
home
because
he
sold
some
poachers
to
slavers
which
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Eddard
Stark
wanted
to
execute
him
for
breaking
the
law
He
fled
instead
Viserys
dismisses
the
charges
as
foolishness
saying
such
things
will
be
tolerated
under
his
rule
Mormont
is
less
certain
that
this
will
happen
Ser
Jorah
is
impressed
by
Daeneryss
growing
ability
to
command
When
Viserys
tries
to
hit
Daenerys
she
is
defended
by
her
bodyguard
Rakharo
who
asks
her
if
she
wants
Viserys
killed
She
commands
that
no
harm
come
to
him
Viserys
orders
Ser
Jorah
to
kill
Daenerys
men
a
suicidal
order
that
Jorah
pointedly
ignores
from
this
point
on
he
is
under
Daeneryss
command
Rakharo
orders
Viseryss
horse
taken
so
he
has
to
walk
a
disgrace
for
a
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Rakharo
debate
combat
techniques
Jorah
talks
to
Rakharo
and
helps
him
learn
some
Westerosi
words
to
better
serve
her
Jorah
and
Rakharo
also
swap
their
opinions
on
the
value
of
swords
and
armors
versus
the
arakh
and
some
personal
information
Jorah
states
that
his
father
is
a
man
of
great
honor
and
integrity
and
that
Jorahs
disgrace
betrayed
him
When
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
he
rides
to
the
nearby
Free
City
of
Qohor
It
is
later
revealed
that
he
sent
information
to
Varys
in
Kings
Landing
about
Daeneryss
pregnancy
Arriving
at
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
asks
Jorah
if
he
thinks
the
Dothraki
could
retake
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
her
House
Mormont
points
out
the
difficulties
of
persuading
them
to
cross
the
Narrow
Sea
but
believes
success
would
be
possible
if
that
could
be
accomplished
and
if
King
Robert
was
foolish
enough
to
meet
them
in
open
battle
He
says
that
if
their
opponents
retreated
behind
stone
walls
the
Dothraki
would
not
be
able
to
root
them
out
They
move
to
discussing
Jorahs
background
and
he
admits
to
selling
the
poachers
as
slaves
to
raise
money
for
his
expensive
wife
When
Daenerys
asks
him
where
his
wife
is
Jorah
replies
that
she
is
with
another
man
in
another
place
Jorah
warning
Viserys
In
Kings
Landing
Eddard
Stark
learns
that
Jorah
Mormont
is
Varyss
agent
and
spy
in
Daeneryss
retinue
He
puts
little
faith
in
Jorahs
information
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
considering
him
a
traitor
who
will
say
anything
for
a
royal
pardon
However
King
Robert
and
his
council
are
adamant
that
his
information
can
be
relied
on
and
order
the
assassination
of
Daenerys
Jorah
translates
for
the
benefit
of
Viserys
during
the
ceremony
where
Daenerys
eats
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
Dosh
khaleen
can
prophesize
about
her
baby
Viserys
thinks
it
is
disgusting
but
when
he
realizes
that
the
Dothraki
love
Daenerys
he
slips
away
Jorah
follows
and
finds
him
trying
to
steal
Daeneryss
three
dragon
eggs
He
is
tired
of
waiting
and
he
wants
to
sell
the
eggs
to
buy
an
army
Viserys
accuses
Jorah
of
having
desires
for
his
sister
but
Jorah
still
stops
him
from
leaving
using
a
variation
of
the
motto
of
his
house
Yet
here
I
stand
Viserys
backs
down
and
leaves
without
the
eggs
Later
when
Viserys
threatens
Daenerys
Jorah
tries
to
stop
him
as
drawing
blood
in
the
sacred
city
is
punishable
by
death
When
Drogo
executes
Viserys
with
a
pot
of
molten
gold
he
urges
Daenerys
to
look
away
but
she
refuses
Ser
Jorah
foils
the
assassination
attempt
of
the
Wineseller
in
the
markets
of
Vaes
Dothrak
Jorah
accompanies
Daenerys
and
her
handmaidens
to
the
market
He
receives
a
message
from
a
lad
one
of
Varyss
informers
that
he
calls
his
Little
Birds
who
says
the
Spider
sends
his
regards
and
hands
him
a
parchment
which
he
says
is
his
pardon
and
he
can
go
home
now
Ser
Jorah
clutches
it
and
looks
at
it
with
longing
but
realizes
it
means
that
if
they
dont
need
anyone
to
spy
on
Daenerys
anymore
she
is
likely
in
danger
He
goes
back
to
the
market
and
seeing
a
wineseller
trying
to
give
Daenerys
a
cask
as
a
gift
he
intervenes
and
prevents
the
assassination
as
the
wine
is
poisoned
Drogo
rewards
his
loyalty
with
a
horse
of
his
choosing
before
vowing
to
invade
and
seize
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
vengeance
Ser
Jorah
accompanies
Daenerys
as
the
khalasar
raids
the
lands
of
Lhazar
When
Daenerys
orders
that
Dothraki
warriors
are
to
be
prevented
from
raping
the
local
women
Ser
Jorah
helps
carry
out
the
order
upsetting
the
Dothraki
He
witnesses
the
fight
between
Drogo
and
Mago
Drogo
wins
but
takes
a
small
wound
Ser
Jorah
carries
Daenerys
to
the
tent
As
Drogos
condition
worsens
Ser
Jorah
fears
for
the
chaos
that
will
be
unleashed
if
he
dies
Daenerys
is
shocked
to
learn
that
her
unborn
son
will
be
killed
in
the
resulting
power
struggle
as
different
bloodriders
fight
to
succeed
Drogo
Jorah
suggests

leave
quietly
and

where
there
is
a
port

Daenerys
refuses
She
begs
the
Lhazareen
witch
Mirri
Maz
Duur
to
help
Drogo
with
blood
magic
and
tells
Ser
Jorah
that
he
should
put
on
his
armor
When
Drogos
bloodrider
Qotho
tries
to
halt
the
ceremony
Ser
Jorah
stops
him
with
his
sword
They
fight
and
the
younger
Dothraki
swiftly
gains
the
upper
hand
through
his
superior
agility
but
his
arakh
is
unable
to
penetrate
Jorahs
heavy
armor
allowing
Jorah
to
kill
him
Daenerys
goes
into
labor
but
the
midwives
are
too
afraid
to
help
her
thinking
she
is
cursed
because
of
the
maegi
Jorah
takes
her
into
Drogos
tent
to
seek
Duurs
aid
Jorah
is
with
Daenerys
when
she
wakes
the
next
morning
He
tells
her
to
rest
but
she
insists
on
being
taken
to
Drogo
and
her
child
She
learns
that
her
son
was
stillborn
badly
malformed
and
that
Drogo
is
alive
but
comatose
while
the
khalasar
has
scattered
to
the
winds
Duur
admits
that
she
orchestrated

condition
and
the
death
of
Daeneryss
son
as
vengeance
for
the
destruction
of
her
village
Daenerys
ends
Drogos
suffering
by
smothering
him
with
a
pillow
Jorah
tries
to
prevent
Daenerys
from
stepping
onto
the
pyre
She
builds
a
funeral
pyre
for
Drogo
has
her
dragon
eggs
placed
on
the
pyre
and
has
Jorah
bind
Duur
to
the
pyre
so
that
she
may
burn
alive
Ser
Jorah
tries
to
stop
Daenerys
from
burning
the
dragon
eggs
as
they
can
be
sold
to
buy
her
a
life
of
travel
to
exotic
places
He
tells
her
he
knows
she
is
planning
on
stepping
onto
the
pyre
as
well
and
says
she
must
not
She
strokes
his
cheek
and
gives
a
speech
to
her
people
saying
that
they
may
go
but
if
they
stay
she
will
lead
them
to
a
great
destiny
She
then
walks
into
the
flames
as
the
remaining
Dothraki
kneel
in
reverence
Jorah
and
Daeneryss
remaining
khalasar
stand
vigil
all
night
until
the
fire
finally
burns
out
In
the
morning
they
find
Daenerys
unhurt
among
the
ashes
with
three
newlyhatched
dragons
A
stunned
Jorah
drops
to
his

and
proclaims
Daenerys
his
queen
and
liege

and
her

After
Danys
mare
Drogos
first
gift
to
her
dies
of
exhaustion
she
wonders
where
should
they
go
and
what
can
she
do
against
starvation
Jorah
reminds
her
that
returning
either
to
Lhazar
or
to
the
Dothraki
sea
would
mean
their
death
and
the
loss
of
her
dragons
at
the
hands
of
either
the
Lhazareen
or
another
khalasar
He
also
reminds

for
her
peoples
sake

inside
Jorah
warns
Daenerys
not
to
look
but
she
insists
She
asks
Jorah
who
killed
Rakharo
and
he
speculates
it
might
have
been
another

or
Khal
Jhaqo
who
are

He
reports

have
invited
Daenerys
to
the
city
Daenerys
asks
Jorah
what
he
knows
of
Qarth
and
he
tells
her
that
the
desert
around
it
is
known
as
the
Garden
of

it
is
littered

reacts
in
anger
despite

to
be
careful
Nevertheless

Xaro
offers
to
fund

in
exchange
for
her
hand
in
marriage
Later
she
seeks
Jorahs
advice
about
the
proposal
and
he
cautions
against
accepting
financial
aid
He
suggests
that
she
will
be
able
to
win
her
throne
should
she
reach
Westeros
with
just
a
single
ship
He
accidentally
reveals
his
depth
of
feeling
for
her
and
while
she
accepts
his
counsel
she
looks
away
and
does
not
reciprocate
While

is
away
seeking
a
ship
Daenerys
appeals

He
finds

appealing
to

they
all
deny

admits
to
taking
them
to
the
House
of
the
Undying
as
part
of
a
deal
struck
with
Xaro
who
has
proclaimed
himself
king

insists
on
reclaiming

dragons
saying
that
they
are
her
children
She
reminds
Jorah
that

has
magic
of

agrees
to
help
her
despite
knowing
they
will
be
walking
into
a
trap
Jorah
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
confront
Xaro
While
searching
for
an
entrance
into
the
House
of
the
Undying
Daenerys
is
magically
transported
inside
leaving
a
distraught
Jorah
calling
for
her
outside
Daenerys
overcomes
the
warlocks
spells
and
reunites
with
her
dragons
Once
they
are
together
she
commands
them
to
breathe
flames
at

sorcerer
killing
him
and
allowing

Season
Jorah
is
on
Daeneryss
ship
that
sailed
from
Qarth
to
Astapor
He
is
also
with
her
when
Kraznys
mo
Nakloz
demonstrates
the
level
of
obedience
of
his
Unsullied
soldiers
by
slicing
off
one
of
their
nipples
and
urges
her
to
purchase
them
During
the
conversation
Daenerys
finds
herself
distracted
by
a
young
girl
playing
with
a
ball
A
cloaked
stranger
appears
from
behind
them
to
knock
the
ball
out
of
her
hands
and
Jorah
engages
in
a
struggle
with
him
The
ball
hits
the
floor
and
cracks
open
to
reveal
a
manticore
which
the
stranger
promptly
stabs
with
his
dagger
When
he
removes
his
hood
Jorah
recognizes
him
as
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
who
pledges
fealty
to
her
Jorah
and
Kovarro
in
the
season
premiere
Valar
Dohaeris
Jorah
reaches
the
Walk
of
Punishment
with
Daenerys
and
Ser
Barristan
He
and
Ser
Barristan
debate
the
merits
of
buying
the
Unsullied
Barristan
advises
Daenerys
that
there
is
no
honor
in
conquering
with
a
purchased
slave
army
Jorah
counters
that
honor
does
not
win
battles
and
that
the
Unsullied
are
not
like
a
regular
army
They
will
not
rape
and
pillage
and
will
only
kill
who
they
are
ordered
to
kill
Daenerys
eventually
offers
one
of
her
dragons
to
Kraznys
in
return
for
all
of
his
Unsullied
a
deal
that
Jorah
and
Barristan
both
strongly
advise
her
against
Nevertheless
Daenerys
stands
her
ground
and
scolds
her
two
advisors
for
contradicting
her
in
public
Jorah
is
present
at
the
Sack
of
Astapor
where
Daenerys
manages
to
both
keep
all
of
her
dragons
and
win
the
army
as
well
as
their
trust
in
her
as
a
queen
and
not
as
a
mistress
effectively
getting
the
best
out
of
both
Jorah
and
Barristans
prior
arguments
On
the
road
north
to
Yunkai
Jorah
reminisces
with
Barristan
about
the
day
he
was
knighted
by
King
Robert
for
his
part
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
He
recalls
that
the
only
thing
on
his
mind
was
how
badly
he
needed
to
urinate
having
been
sealed
in
armor
for
sixteen
hours
Barristan
prods
Jorah
about
his
past
when
he
was
disgraced
and
exiled
for
his
involvement
in
the
slave
trade
and
warns
him
that
his
presence
alongside
Daenerys
may
harm
her
image
in
Westeros
Jorah
questions
Barristan
about
the
advisors
on
King
Roberts
Small
Council
subtly
trying
to
ascertain
whether
Barristan
knows
that
he
was
previously
spying
on
Daenerys
for
Varys
However
Barristan
explains
that
as
a
former
Targaryen
loyalist
King
Robert
did
not
fully
trust
him
and
excluded
him
from
council
meetings
Jorah
and
Barristan
briefly
bicker
about
the
fact
that
Barristan
has
only
just
arrived
while
Jorah
has
been
protecting
Daenerys
for
months
Jorah
tells
Barristan
that
he
is
not
Lord
Commander
here
and
he
only
takes
orders
from
Daenerys
Upon
arriving
at
Yunkais
gates
Jorah
is
dismissive
of
Daeneryss
and
Barristans
claims
that
its
reputation
for
training
bed
slaves
rather
than
soldiers
will
give
them
a
clear
advantage
and
explains
that
Yunkai
will
in
all
likelihood
just
shut
its
gates
and
chip
away
at
Daeneryss
army
using
guerilla
tactics
He
also
advises
Dany
that
conquering
Yunkai
is
irrelevant
in
their
quest
to
return
to
Westeros
but
she
is
adamant
on
freeing
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
slaves
within
the
city
walls
Jorah
is
present
in
Daeneryss
tent
when
the
Yunkish
slavetrader
Razdal
mo
Eraz
arrives
bearing
gifts
Following
her
orders
he
spies
on
the
mercenary
group
the
Second
Sons
and
is
again
present
in
her
tent
when
she
is
hosting
the
two
mercenary
captains
Mero
and
Prendahl
na
Ghezn
and
their
lieutenant
Daario
Naharis
Mero
is
sexually
vulgar
towards
Daenerys
which
prompts
Ser
Jorah
to
threaten
him
to
mind
his
tongue
With
Daarios
help
Jorah
and
Grey
Worm
enter
Yunkai
from
one
of
its
posterior
tunnels
and
the
three
of
them
successfully
fight
off
a
number
of
guards
and
open
the
gates
of
Yunkai
from
the
inside
allowing
the
Unsullied
to
sweep
in
and
win
the
city
for
Daenerys
Jorah
however
is
noticably
distraught
when
all
of
Daeneryss
postvictory
attention
is
centered
on
Daario
Jorah
along
with
Ser
Barristan
Daario
and
Missandei
is
also
present
when
Daenerys
is
greeted
with
open
arms
by
the
newly
freed
slaves
of
Yunkai
Season
While
feeding
her
dragons
Dany
is
warned
by
Jorah
once
again
about
the
fact
that
they
are
not
tameable
beasts
He
also
informs
her
that
Daario
Naharis
and
Grey
Worm
are
gambling
When
the
army
of
Unsullied
halts
in
unison
Jorah
faces
the
crucifixion
of
a
small
child
one
of
along
the
path
to
Meereen
greatest
of
the
cities
of
Slavers
Bay
As
the
one
who
has
been
at
her
side
the
longest
Ser
Jorah
volunteers
to
face
the
champion
sent
out
by
Meereen
when
Daenerys
arrives
at
their
gates
Daenerys
refuses
to
gamble
with
the
life
of
her
most
trusted
advisor
general
and
dearest
friend
Ser
Jorah
is
confronted
by
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
regarding
Mormonts
royal
pardon
Ser
Jorah
informs
Daenerys
that
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
has
been
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
He
also
informs
her
of
the
disasters
in
the
two
cities
she
liberated
Yunkai
and
Astapor
Daeneryss
companions
debate
about
possibly
mounting
an
invasion
of
Westeros
due
to
its
current
state
Jorah
is
against
it
stating
that
their
forces
could
not
conquer
all
of
Westeros
alone
and
they
have
no
real
allies
on
the
continent
After
Daenerys
dismisses
the
rest
of
her
council
she
tells
Jorah
that
her
business
in
Slavers
Bay
is
not
yet
complete
and
intends
to
stay
Some
weeks
later
Jorah
enters
Daeneryss
chambers
early
in
the
morning
and
is
not
pleased
to
find
a
partiallydressed
Daario
exiting
Daario
quips
that
it
is
a
good
time
to
petition
Daenerys
because
she
is
in
a
very
good
mood
Entering
the
queens
conference
room
he
expresses
his
distrust
for
Daario
insinuating
that
Daario
only
murdered
his
superiors
and
joined
forces
with
Daenerys
out
of
lust
and
thus
is
not
a
trustworthy
ally
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
she
sent
Daario
to
take
the
Second
Sons
to
Yunkai
to
regain
control
over
the
city
and
kill
the
masters
that
have
resurfaced
Jorah
relates
to
the
mercy
shown
by
Eddard
Stark
for
his
dealings
in
slavery
and
convinces
Daenerys
to
bring
the
masters
to
justice
without
execution
Daenerys
considers
for
a
moment
and
then
tells
Jorah
to
assign
Hizdahr
zo
Loraq
as
her
ambassador
to
offer
the
masters
a
choice
they
can
live
free
in
the
new
world
she
wants
to
create
or
they
can
die
clinging
to
their
old
one
The
Second
Sons
will
be
stationed
in
Yunkai
to
enforce
whichever
choice
the
masters
make
She
also
says
to
let
Daario
know
that
it
was
Jorah
who
changed
her
mind
Daenerys
banishes
Ser
Jorah
from
her
service
As
Barristan
Selmy
watches
the
Unsullied
taking
down
the
crucified
slave
masters
outside
of
Meereen
a
small
boy
approaches
him
giving
him
a
scroll
bearing
the
seal
of
the
kings
hand
As
Barristan
reads
it
he
realizes
that
the
letter
was
signed
by
Robert
Baratheon
the
same
year
Jorah
and
Daenerys
first
met
each
other
Barristan
confronts
Jorah
about
this
before
telling
Daenerys
saying
that
he
doesnt
want
to
go
behind
Jorahs
back
He
tells
Jorah
that
he
knows
the
truth
Jorah
was
intially
working
as
a
spy
for
Robert
As
Jorah
asks
to
speak
with
Daenerys
alone
Barristan
tells
him
you
will
never
be
alone
with
her
again
In
the
throne
room
as
Jorah
walks
up
the
steps
towards
Daenerys
the
tension
mounts
when
she
asks
for
an
explanation
Jorah
explains
that
the
situation
is
a
ploy
by
TywinLannister
in
order
to
divide
them
However
as
the
scroll
was
signed
the
year
Jorah
first
met
Daenerys
she
asks
if
the
pardon
was
forged
Reluctantly
Jorah
tells
the
truth
at
Daeneryss
request
He
confesses
to
providing
the
spider
the
information
on
Daeneryss
activities
in
Essos
Ser
Jorah
leaves
Meereen
Daenerys
gets
angry
when
Jorah
also
admits
that
he
provided
the
information
of
her
pregnancy
with
Drogos
child
as
it
led
to
her
nearly
getting
poisoned
by
the
wine
merchant
outside
of
VaesDothrak
Jorah
defensively
tells
her
that
if
it
hadnt
been
for
him
she
would
have
been
poisoned
but
she
counters
that
was
only
because
he
saw
it
coming
Jorah
calls
her
name
and
begs
for
her
forgiveness
but
she
rejects
saying
that
he
sold
all
her
secrets
to
Robert
the
man
whom
she
finds
guilty
of
her
familys
murder
Jorah
is
forced
to
leave
the
city
within
the
day
or
have
his
head
thrown
into
the
Slavers
Bay
Jorah
then
leaves
Meereen
Season
Ser
Jorah
kidnaps
Tyrion
intending
to
take
him
to
Daenerys
Jorah
resurfaces
in
Volantis
drinking
in
a
brothel
and
shamefully
eyeing
a
whore
dressed
as
Daenerys
From
afar
he
recognizes
Tyrion
Lannister
and
Varys
Jorah
later
approaches
Tyrion
while
he
is
urinating
alone
and
binds
him
with
rope
and
gags
him
telling
Tyrion
that
he
is
taking
him
to
the
Queen
With
Tyrion
captive
Jorah
steals
a
small
boat
and
begins
to
sail
east
towards
Meereen
En
route
Tyrion
pesters
Jorah
with
muffled
whining
until
he
relents
and
removes
Tyrions
gag
Tyrion
notices
that
they
are
traveling
east
and
not
west
towards
Cersei
in
Kings
Landing
Jorah
reveals
that
he
is
taking
Tyrion
to
the
queen
he
serves
Daenerys
Targaryen
Tyrion
is
pleasantly
surprised
and
tries
to
convince
him
that
they
are
on
the
same
side
since
he
was
traveling
to
meet
Daenerys
anyway
He
also
accurately
deduces
who
Jorah
is
by
his
appearance
and
equipment
He
also
correctly
assumes
that
Jorah
must
have
been
banished
by
Daenerys
because
she
discovered
that
he
was
spying
on
her
for
Varys
Tyrion
mockingly
asks
Jorah
if
he
really
believes
that
he
will
earn
a
pardon
for
simply
delivering
him
to
Daenerys
alternately
she
might
pardon
Tyrion
and
behead
Jorah
instead
Fed
up
with
his
captive
Jorah
knocks
Tyrion
across
the
face
leaving
him
unconscious
Ser
Jorah
notices
that
his
wrist
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
As
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
their
journey
Tyrion
continues
to
mock
House
Mormont
as
well
as
Bear
Island
Eventually
the
two
find
Old
Valyria
and
passes
through
its
ruins
to
find
Meereen
While
sailing
through
the
ruins
the
two
look
in
astonishment
as
they
see
Drogon
fly
past
them
In
a
quick
turn
of
events
men
infected
with
Greyscale
appear
and
attack
the
two
Jorah
manages
to
fight
them
off
but
Tyrion
is
pulled
underwater
When
Tyrion
wakes
up
he
finds
himself
on
shore
saved
by
Jorah
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
but
Jorah
looks
at
his
wrists
and
notices
he
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
towards
Meereen
on
foot
having
failed
to
acquire
a
boat
During
conversation
Tyrion
mentions
to
Jorah
that
he
knew
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
from
his
trip
to
the
Wall
and
reveals
that
he
was
killed
by
his
own
men
in
a
mutiny
while
returning
from
a
great
ranging
leaving
Jorah
visibly
saddened
at
his
fathers
death
Jorah
is
also
pressed
by
Tyrion
for
information
as
to
why
he
is
serving
Daenerys
in
the
first
place
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
captured
by
slavers
Jorah
tells
him
that
he
grew
to
truly
believe
in
her
when
he
saw
her
emerge
from
Khal
Drogos
funeral
pyre
unscathed
with
three
dragon
hatchlings
and
that
she
also
has
a
birthright
to
the
throne
even
though
Tyrion
mentions
the
infamous
Targaryen
madness
that
may
surface
in
her
later
in
life
However
they
are
found
and
captured
by
slavers
The
leader
Malko
plans
to
sell
them
in
Volantis
but
Tyrion
convinces
them
to
allow
Jorah
to
participate
in
the
fighting
pits
in
Meereen
to
make
them
rich
offering
the
information
that
Jorah
once
unseated
Jaime
Lannister
in
a
jousting
match
When
Malko
scoffs
this
Jorah
brings
up
that
he
slew
Qotho
in
single
combat
inciting
Malkos
interest
and
convincing
him
to
take
them
to
Meereen
On
the
outskirts
of
Meereen
Jorah
is
put
on
auction
by
Malko
who
exaggerates
Jorahs
accomplishments
by
claiming
that
along
with
fighting
alongside
The
Stag
King
he
took
part
in
the
attack
on
Spike
with
his
flaming
sword
when
it
was
really
Thoros
of
Myr
singlehandedly
killed
Khal
Drogo
and
was
betrayed
by
his
wife
and
willingly
sold
into
slavery
in
order
to
repay
his
debts
A
slaver
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
buys
Jorah
and
Tyrion
as
well
when
Tyrion
convinces
him
They
are
taken
to
one
of
the
fighting
pits
and
when
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
present
for
the
opening
of
the
games
he
takes
a
sword
and
enters
the
arena
knocking
out
the
other
fighters
while
disguised
with
a
helmet
Jorah
approaches
Daenerys
and
removes
his
helmet
to
reveal
his
identity
but
Daenerys
who
still
hasnt
forgiven
him
orders
Jorah
to
be
taken
away
Jorah
informs
her
that
he
has
brought
a
gift
and
Tyrion
reveals
himself
meeting
Daenerys
facetoface
at
last
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
brought
before
Daenerys
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Back
in
Meereen
Daenerys
after
learning
Tyrion
wants
to
advise
her
asks
him
what
he
thinks
she
should
do
with
Jorah
Tyrion
tells
her
how
devoted
Jorah
seemed
to
be
to
her
and
that
he
did
not
think
she
would
be
wise
enough
to
forgive
him
He
then
tells
her
how
killing
people
devoted
to
her
is
not
a
ruler
who
inspires
devotion
and
that
she
would
need
lots
of
it
if
she
was
ever
going
to
rule
Westeros
but
when
she
did
he
couldnt
be
by
her
side
Daenerys
then
orders
Jorah
removed
from
the
city
once
more
Jorah
with
his
Greyscale
slowly
progressing
returns
to
the
fighting
pits
where
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
remains
Since
he
won
the
earlier
match
Jorah
demanded
that
he
fight
at
the
great
pit
in
front
of
the
queen
Jorah
says
he
is
the
best
he
has
and
that
if
he
wins
he
will
belong
to
Yezzan
Jorah
later
joins
the
Great
Games
in
Daznaks
Pit
in
front
of
the
queen
along
with
a
Water
Dancer
from
Braavos
a
Dothraki
warrior
a
Summer
Islander
with
a
halberd
a
Meereenese
champion
wielding
a
spear
and
another
fighter
When
Daenerys
recognizes
Jorah
she
is
visibly
distraught
and
as
the
fighting
continues
and
Jorah
is
severely
wounded
by
the
water
dancer
Tyrion
reminds
Daenerys
that
she
could
stop
the
fight
at
any
moment
to
save
Jorah
Ser
Jorah
fighting
in
the
Great
Pit
of
Daznak
Even
though
the
fear
is
clearly
shown
on
her
face
Daenerys
refuses
Jorah
manages
to
win
the
fight
despite
being
outmatched
during
most
of
it
Just
as
the
fight
ends
Jorah
throws
a
spear
towards
Daenerys
who
believing
the
spear
was
meant
for
her
ducks
out
of
the
way
The
spear
is
revealed
to
be
meant
for
a
Son
of
the
Harpy
who
was
sneaking
up
behind
her
Much
of
the
audience
reveals
themselves
to
be
Sons
of
the
Harpy
proceeding
to
kill
everyone
they
can
Jorah
joins
the
ensuing
battle
for
Daenerys
and
tries
to
help
escort
her
out
of
the
fighting
pit
but
they
eventually
end
up
surrounded
and
vastly
outnumbered
At
that
moment
Drogon
appears
in
the
arena
and
starts
killing
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
and
scaring
off
the
rest
Jorah
Tyrion
Daario
and
Missandei
all
observe
in
awe
as
Daenerys
flies
off
on
Drogon
Back
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Tyrion
addresses
both
Jorah
and
Daarios
feelings
for
Daenerys
understanding
how
one
could
love
the
wrong
woman
The
three
argue
about
Jorahs
betrayal
but
they
will
not
make
any
judgments
without
Daenerys
first
Jorah
Tyrion
and
Daario
plan
their
next
move
The
dragon
was
seen
taking
her
north
and
it
is
agreed
that
Jorah
will
join
Daario
to
ride
and
search
for
her
Grey
Worm
still
recovering
from
his
injuries
offers
to
go
with
them
as
does
Tyrion
Daario
firmly
nixes
both
ideas
Grey
Worm
is
needed
to
command
the
Unsullied
in
keeping
the
city
under
control
while
Tyrion
is
the
only
one
of
them
to
have
any
political
experience
Thus
Daario
and
Jorah
depart
together
hoping
to
find
their
Queen
in
the
Dothraki
Sea
Season
Jorah
and
Daario
search
for
Dany
Jorah
and
Daario
follow
Drogons
trail
into
the
Dothraki
sea
where
Daario
gets
him
to
admit
he
is
in
love
with
Daenerys
While
Daario
isnt
looking
Jorah
examines
the
spreading
greyscale
on
his
arm
to
determine
how
long
he
has
left
to
live
They
eventually
discover
a
circle
of
hoof
prints
where
Jorah
finds
Daeneryss
ring
in
the
middle
leading
them
to
realize
a
Dothraki
khalasar
has
taken
her
captive
Jorah
and
Daario
make
their
way
to
Vaes
Dothrak
with
Daario
taunting
Jorah
about
how
Daenerys
chose
him
as
her
lover
Jorah
scans
the
city
and
deduces
that
Daenerys
has
been
taken
to
the
temple
of
the
dosh
khaleen
Jorah
and
Daario
leave
their
weapons
outside
the
city
and
Daario
notices
Jorahs
greyscale
Jorah
assures
Daario
that
he
was
not
infected
The
two
sneak
into
the
city
at
night
and
are
caught
by
two
Dothraki
Jorah
tries
to
pass
off
himself
and
Daario
as
lost
merchants
but
the
Dothraki
see
through
the
ruse
After
killing
them
Jorah
and
Daario
find
Daenerys
and
offer
to
help
her
escape
the
city
but
she
enlists
them
in
her
plan
to
take
control
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Daario
kill
the
guards
outside
the
temple
in
which
the
khals
are
determining
Daeneryss
fate
and
bar
the
door
resulting
in
the
khals
being
unable
to
escape
when
Daenerys
sets
the
temple
ablaze
When
Daenerys
emerges
from
the
inferno
unburnt
Jorah
and
Daario
bow
before
her
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
shows
Daenerys
his
greyscale
sickness
The
next
day
overlooking
the
smoldering
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
Daenerys
confronts
Jorah
She
reminds
him
that
she
has
banished
him
twice
but
remembers
that
he
has
twice
returned
and
has
saved
her
life
As
she
ponders
what
to
do
Jorah
interjects
that
she
must
send
him
away
revealing
his
greyscale
He
explains
that
he
does
not
know
of
a
cure
or
how
long
the
disease
takes
but
that
he
will
end
things
before
he
becomes
a
stone
man
himself
Jorah
then
tells
Daenerys
that
Tyrion
Lannister
was
right
about
him
he
loves
her
and
will
always
love
her
and
begins
to
leave
Daenerys
stops
him
and
rather
than
dismissing
him
tearfully
orders
Jorah
to
go
and
find
a
cure
for
his
disease
so
that
he
may
be
by
her
side
when
she
takes
back
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Jorah
and
Dany
then
part
on
good
terms
as
he
watches
her
lead
her
new
khalasar
out
of
Vaes
Dothrak
before
embarking
on
his
own
new
quest
Season
Sam
performs
a
risky
treatment
on
Jorah
to
cure
him
of
his
greyscale
Jorah
has
traveled
to
Oldtown
seeking
a
cure
for
his
greyscale
but
has
been
placed
inside
one
of
the
sick
cells
in
the
Citadel
As
Samwell
Tarly
is
collecting
empty
bowls
from
cells
Jorah
reaches
out
for
him
his
infection
having
spread
rapidly
and
asks
if
Daenerys
has
reached
Westeros
yet
but
Sam
claims
he
does
not
know
Jorah
is
later
deemed
beyond
saving
by
Archmaester
Ebrose
and
is
told
that
he
has
one
more
day
before
he
will
be
deported
to
the
Valyrian
Peninsula
to
live
out
the
rest
of
his
days
with
the
stone
men
as
the
greyscale
will
take
over
his
mind
in
six
months
Within
that
time
he
still
seeks
to
end
his
own
life
before
then
He
properly
introduces
himself
to
Samwell
explaining
that
there
is
no
point
writing
to
Lyanna
Mormont
as
House
Mormont
forgot
about
him
a
long
time
ago
Jorah
returns
to
Dany
Later
that
night
as
Jorah
writes
a
farewell
note
to
Daenerys
he
is
visited
by
Sam
who
claims
that
out
of
respect
for
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
he
will
try
to
save
him
from
his
greyscale
though
he
admits
he
has
never
tried
before
and
is
the
only
one
who
will
despite
it
being
risky
for
both
Sam
and
Jorah
Aware
of
the
alternative
Jorah
consents
to
the
treatment
He
is
given
rum
as
anesthesia
and
a
mouthguard
to
bite
on
during
the
painful
procedure
to
stay
silent
Bearing
the
pain
Jorah
allows
Sam
to
start
peeling
his
infected
skin
away
With
his
greyscale
now
cured
by
Samwell
Ebrose
allows
the
release
of
Jorah
from
his
cell
When
Ebrose
asks
of
the
disease
Jorah
says
it
must
have
cured
itself
from
having
plenty
of
rest
Before
Jorah
leaves
he
tells
Sam
he
will
return
to
Daenerys
that
both
she
and
Sam
has
saved
his
life
Jorah
shakes
Sams
hand
in
gratitude
before
leaving
After
leaving
the
Citadel
Jorah
makes
his
way
to
Dragonstone
where
he
is
finally
reunited
with
Daenerys
who
gladly
accepts
him
back
into
her
service
and
calls
him
a
friend
He
also
meets
Jon
Snow
who
served
under
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
in
the
Nights
Watch
Jorah
later
attends
a
meeting
during
which
Tyrion
Lannister
suggests
that
they
should
capture
a
wight
and
bring
it
to
Cersei
Lannister
thus
proving
that
the
army
of
the
dead
is
marching
upon
Westeros
and
allowing
Daenerys
to
take
her
troops
to
help
Jon
Jorah
volunteers
to
join
the
mission
and
leaves
Dragonstone
with
Jon
Davos
Seaworth
and
Gendry
Upon
arriving
at
EastwatchbytheSea
Jorah
quickly
recognizes
the
imprisoned
Thoros
of
Myr
having
fought
together
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
Unfortunately
the
mention
of
Jorahs
family
name
creates
friction
with
Tormund
due
to
Jeor
Mormonts
role
in
persecuting
the
wildlings
Nevertheless
Jorah
accompanies
the
party
north
of
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Jon
to
keep
Longclaw
Once
beyond
the
Wall
Jorah
discusses
his
fathers
death
with
Jon
Snow
stating
that
being
killed
by
his
own
men
was
the
worst
way
for
Jeor
to
pass
away
They
also
discuss
the
fact
that
Ned
Stark
wanted
to
execute
Jorah
and
Jon
offers
to
give
Longclaw
back
to
House
Mormont
However
Jorah
refuses
as
he
brought
shame
on
his
family
he
has
no
longer
the
right
to
wield
the
weapon
which
must
remain
with
Jon
as
Jeor
wanted
Later
the
party
is
attacked
by
an
undead
bear
which
severely
injures
Thoros
before
Jorah
kills
the
beast
with
a
final
strike
Jorah
and
Thoros
then
discuss
the
Siege
of
Pyke
with
Thoros
acknowledging
that
he
was
so
drunk
that
day
that
he
completely
forgot
the
battle
Jorah
assists
in
subduing
a
wight
The
party
finally
encounters
a
small
group
of
wights
led
by
a
White
Walker
They
attack
it
and
Jorah
is
assaulted
by
a
wight
who
tries
to
choke
him
to
death
before
being
shattered
when
Jon
kills
the
White
Walker
leading
them
They
successfully
capture
an
undead
but
it
draw
the
attention
of
the
whole
undead
army
which
rushed
at
them
While
Gendry
returns
to
Eastwatch
to
send
a
raven
to
Daenerys
Jorah
and
the
others
find
refuge
on
a
small
island
in
the
middle
of
the
frozen
lake
that
the
wights
cannot
cross
They
spend
the
night
on
the
rocks
to
which
Thoros
does
not
survive
and
are
later
attacked
by
the
army
of
the
Night
King
as
the
ice
layer
over
the
water
is
solid
enough
Jorah
fights
along
the
others
with
a
pair
of
dragonglass
daggers
destroying
many
wights
but
the
party
is
easily
outnumbered
and
only
survives
thanks
to
the
arrival
of
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
Jorah
is
shocked
and
saddened
when
he
witnesses
the
death
of
Daenerys
youngest
dragon
Viserion
at
the
hands
of
the
Night
King
The
survivors
manage
to
escape
except
Jon
Snow
who
is
taken
beneath
the

Back
to
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Daenerys
that
they
should
return
to
Kings
Landing
and
attends
Jons
return
to
Eastwatch
after
he
was
saved
by
Benjen
Stark
Jorah
during
the
negotiation
in
the
Dragonpit
Jorah
goes
to
Kings
Landing
to
attend
the
negotiation
between
Daenerys
Cersei
and
Jon
explaining
the
origins
of
the
Dragonpit
to
Missandei
on
the
way
They
are
greeted
by
Bronn
who
escorts
them
to
their
seats
with
Jorah
sitting
right
next
to
Daenerys
Jorah
does
not
speak
during
the
discussions
Like
everyone
else
he
is
surprised
when
Jon
openly
pledges
allegiance
to
Daenerys
and
stays
at
the
Dragonpit
while
Tyrion
tries
to
convince
Cersei
to
help
them
after
she
left
the
negotiation
After
Cersei
seemingly
agrees
to
send
troops
to
fight
the
army
of
the
Night
King
Jorah
leaves
Kings
Landing
with
the
others
and
make
his
way
to
the
North
Personality
Jorah
is
a
complex
character
as
he
isDaenerys
Targaryens
most
loyal
advisor
and
a
formidable
warrior
Jorah
has
a
deep
respect
loyalty
and
love
for
Daenerys
and
has
always
tried
to
give
her
reasonable
practical
and
effective
advice
While
Jorah
is
a
moral
person
and
always
tries
to
be
honorable
he
has
done
several
dishonorable
acts
out
of
love
or
for
his
own
survival
He
sold
poachers
into
slavery
to
pay
for
his
wifes
spending
habits
fled
Westeros
to
escape
executionand
briefly
spied
on
Daenerys
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
royal
pardon
though
he
stopped
spying
on
her
after
becoming
her
advisor
Jorah
is
Daeneryss
most
levelheaded
advisor
at
least
until
the
arrival
of
Barristan
Selmy
Jorah
is
intelligent
literate
and
well
travelled
knowing
the
histories
of
Essos
and
speaking
several
tongues
including
Dothraki
His
relationship
with
his
father
and
likely
the
rest
of
his
family
wasnt
approached
until
the
fifth
season
Although
he
never
showed
any
feelings
towards
Jeor
once
he
was
given
the
news
about
his
death
Jorah
was
visibly
shaken
and
deeply
upset
even
angrily
demanding
to
know
the
details
of
his
fathers
death
This
is
most
likely
because
he
was
still
feeling
guilty
about
bringing
his
family
shame
and
never
fully
reconciling
with
Jeor
Although
stoic
shortspoken
and
sometimes
cold
Jorah
does
have
the
ability
to
warm
up
to
people
once
they
earn
his
respect
At
first
he
treated
Tyrion
like
a
hostage
but
later
after
the
two
barely
survived
the
sinking
of
their
boat
he
started
to
trust
Tyrion
enough
to
leave
him
untied
and
later
the
two
men
shared
their
life
stories
and
freely
discussed
Daenerys
and
her
claim
to
the
throne
although
their
newfound
trust
was
shattered
when
Tyrion
convinced
Daenerys
to
exile
Jorah
from
Meereen
again
which
he
did
to
spare
him
Daeneryss
wrath
He
is
also
a
skilled
warrior
though
he
does
have
a
honor
code
and
tries
not
to
kill
his
opponent
if
such
option
is
possible
This
is
shown
in
the
fighting
pit
where
every
other
warrior
was
brutally
slaughtering
one
another
but
Jorah
came
victorious
without
any
loss
of
life
in
his
hands
This
worked
in
his
favor
since
he
was
aware
that
Daenerys
was
becoming
increasingly
appalled
by
the
needless
violence
happening
in
the
pit
right
before
Jorah
got
into
the
skirmish
And
even
after
using
brute
force
to
harm
another
person
he
does
seem
to
try
compensate
for
his
actions
as
he
did
give
some
money
to
a
knocked
out
fisherman
for
his
stolen
boat
Also
Jorah
has
an
immense
tolerance
for
pain
as
he
managed
to
stay
silent
during
Sams
procedure
to
cure
him
of
the
greyscale
even
though
the
Citadel
apprentice
was
effectively
cutting
bits
of
Jorahs
own
skin

thoughts
on
Jorah
while
conversing
with
Daenerys
Targaryensrc
Behind
the
scenes
On
the
Season
Bluray
Jorah
narrates
a
Histories
Lore
video
on
The
Free
Cities
On
the
Season
Bluray
he
narrates
Slavers
Bay
and
The
Unsullied
and
on
Season
Bluray
he
narrates
Valyrian
Steel
in
which
he
also
mentions
his
own
past
and
family
He
also
narrates
Vaes
Dothrak
and
The
Dothraki
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Jorah
is
described
as
balding
and
hairy
but
still
fit
though
not
a
handsome
man
He
is
the
son
of
Lord
Jeor
Mormont
of
Bear
Island
He
won
honor
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
when
he
was
one
of
the
first
through
the
breach
during
the
storming
of
Pyke
For
his
valor
he
won
praise
from
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
a
knighthood
With
a
strong
vigorous
son
ready
to
take
over
the
lordship
Jeor
decided
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
where
he
rapidly
rose
to
the
rank
of
Lord
Commander
leaving
Jorah
as
Lord
of
Bear
Island
Jorahs
first
wife
was
an
unnamed
woman
of
House
Glover
who
was
unable
to
carry
a
child
to
term
in
ten
years
of
marriage
and
died
after
a
third
miscarriage
She
has
not
been
referred
to
in
the
TV
series
He
later
married
Lynesse
Hightower
of
the
extremely
powerful
House
Hightower
of
Oldtown
after
winning
a
tournament
to
celebrate
the
victory
of
King
Robert
against
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
in
which
Jorah
wore
Lynesses
favor
Lynesse
was
used
to
the
riches
and
luxury
of
the
secondlargest
city
in
Westeros
and
found
Bear
Island
primitive
and
crude
Jorahs
attempts
to
please
his
wife
led
to
him
spending
all
of
his
money
He
disgraced
himself
through
behavior
unbefitting
a
lord
by
arresting
poachers
and
selling
them
to
slavers
Slavery
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
has
been
for
millennia
When
Eddard
Stark
came
to
arrest
Jorah
he
and
Lynesse
fled
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
the
Free
City
of
Lys
leaving
his
aunt
Maege
to
become
the
ruling
Lady
of
Bear
Island
Jorah
attempted
to
make
his
living
as
a
sellsword
but
was
unable
to
provide
an
income
acceptable
to
Lynesse
She
left
him
and
became
a
concubine
to
the
merchant
lord
Tregar
Ormollen
who
then
exiled
Jorah
from
the
city
Daenerys
learns
of
Jorahs
past
spying
for
Varys
earlier
in
the
book
narrative
before
she
conquers
Meereen
Ser
Barristan
initially
conceals
his
true
identity
from
her
claiming
to
be
a
squire
named
Arstan
Whitebeard
this
storyline
was
omitted
from
the
TV
series
and
when
he
finally
reveals
himself
he
also
tells
her
of
Jorahs
treachery
which
Barristan
knew
from
attending
Roberts
small
council
meetings
in
the
series
Barristan
was
not
a
member
of
the
small
council
and
thus
he
knew
nothing
of
Jorahs
spying
She
initially
dismisses
both
and
assigns
them
a
suicide
mission
to
conquer
Meereen
by
entering
the
city
via
its
sewers
To
her
surprise
and
disappointment
both
survive
the
mission
and
help
her
capture
the
city
She
forgives
Ser
Barristan
and
readmits
him
into
her
service
She
intends
to
pardon
Jorah
too
but
is
angered
by
his
attitude
he
remains
defensive
and
lacks
contrition
when
she
thinks
he
ought
to
be
begging
for
her
forgiveness
so
she
dismisses
him
although
she
fights
back
tears
as
she
does
so
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
if
she
sees
him
again
she
will
order
Strong
Belwas
who
does
not
appear
in
the
TV
series
to
wrench
his
head
off
Daario
Naharis
offers
to
kill
Jorah
for
her
but
Daenerys
decides
to
spare
him
and
he
is
allowed
to
leave
the
city
Daario
warns
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
kill
Jorah
or
otherwise
keep
him
close
There
is
no
mentioning
in
the
books
that
Jorah
ever
served
in
the
Golden
Company
though
it
is
said
that
after
Lynesse
left
him
he
scraped
by
as
a
sellsword
for
years
until
he
came
to
Pentos
to
spy
on
the
Targaryens
At
first
he
fought
as
a
sellsword
for
Lys
but
after
Lynesses
new
lover
exiled
him
from
the
city
he
drifted
to
Volantis
where
he
spent
the
better
part
of
a
year
working
as
a
sellsword
and
owning
nothing
but
his
sword
Jorah
is
never
attacked
by
Stone
Men
or
infected
with
Greyscale
Instead
Tyrion
was
attacked
by
Stone
Men
earlier
in
his
journeyin
the
ruins
of
Chroyane
instead
of
Valyria
It
is
a
man
named
Griff
one
of
Tyrions
companions
at
the
time
who
gets
infected
with
Greyscale
instead
Jorah
Tyrion
and
their
dwarf
companion
board
a
ship
at
Volantis
heading
for
Qarth
The
ship
is
badly
damaged
in
a
storm
After
drifting
for
at
least
nineteen
days
slavers
from
Yunkai
appear
Tyrion
and
all
the
rest
of
the
passangers
yield
without
fight
but
Jorah
resists
fiercely
and
kills
three
of
the
slavers
before
he
is
overcome
As
a
result
the
slavers
treat
him
much
more
harshly
than
their
other
captives
he
has
been
chained
to
an
oar
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
starved
and
branded
with
a
tattoo
of
demons
mask
on
one
cheek
His
face
has
been
so
bruised
and
swollen
that
he
is
almost
unrecognizable
Although
Jorah
has
treated
Tyrion
very
brutally
Tyrion
takes
no
pleasure
from
Jorahs
miseries
The
slavers
who
capture
Jorah
and
Tyrion
have
no
idea
who
Jorah
is
He
is
introduced
by
the
auctioneer
simply
as
big
and
strong
man
He
is
nearly
bought
by
Zahrina
for
the
fighting
pits
but
Tyrion
intervenes
and
persuades
the
overseer
of
Yezzans
slaves
to
buy
Jorah
too
claiming
that
he
takes
part
in
the
show
that
Tyrion
and
his
other
companion
play
for
entertainment
Jorah
does
not
try
to
escape
or
resist
his
captors
he
simply
ignores
their
commands
with
muttered
curses
so
he
is
locked
in
a
cage
and
beaten
severely
every
evening
to
the
point
that
he
hardly
looks
human
He
is
kept
naked
except
for
a
breechclout
a
filthy
bit
of
yellow
rag
He
never
gets
to
see
Daenerys
let
alone
speak
with
her
and
she
has
no
idea
he
is
nearby
Following
Daeneryss
departure
from
Meereen
Tyrion
and
Jorah
escape
from
Yezzan
to
the
camp
of
the
Second
Sons
who
betrayed
Daenerys
and

Daenerys
of

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Daena
was
the
bride
of
her
brother
King
Baelor
Targaryen
He
had
taken
her
as
his
wife
at
the
insistence
of
his
father
Aegon
III
However
the
two
never
consummated
their
marriage
Instead
Baelor
had
dissolved
his
marriage
to
Daena
and
then
along
with
her
sisters
Rhaena
and
Elaena
locked
her
inside
a
section
of
the
Red
Keep
that
would
become
known
as
the
Maidenvault
so
they
wouldnt
incite
him
or
others
in
the
court
to
lust
During
this
time
she
escaped
her
confinement
several
times
and
had
an
affair
with
her
first
cousin
Aegon
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
married
to
his
sister
Naerys
When
she
became
pregnant
she
refused
to
name
the
father
and
became
known
as
Daena
the
Defiant
She
named
her
son
Daemon
and
raised
him
alone
The
royal
succession
laws
were
changed
after
the
disastrous
civil
war
between
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
Aegon
IIIs
mother
and
Rhaenyras
halfbrother
Aegon
II
While
under
normal
Andal
inheritance
law
a
lords
daughter
would
inherit
his
lands
and
titles
if
he
had
no
surviving
sons
the
new
laws
wanted
to
ensure
that
another
royal
succession
war
such
as
the
one
surrounding
Rhaenyra
would
never
occur
again
Therefore
the
new
succession
laws
enacted
during
the
reign
of
Daenas
own
father
put
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
heirs
Under
normal
Andal
inheritance
laws
with
both
of
Aegon
IIIs
sons
dead
the
throne
should
have
passed
to
Daena
as
his
eldest
surviving
daughter
Under
the
new
inheritance
laws
however
the
throne
had
to
pass
to
Aegon
IIIs
nearest
surviving
male
heir
his
younger
brother
Viserys
II
uncle
of
Daena
and
father
of
her
lover
Aegon
Daenas
cousin
Aegon
later
succeeded
his
father
as
King
Aegon
IV
On
his
deathbed
Aegon
IV
legitimized
all
of
his
bastard
children
including
acknowledging
that
Daemon
was
in
fact
his
own
son
He
even
gave
Daemon
the
ancestral
Valyrian
steel
sword
of
House
Targaryen
Blackfyre
which
had
been
wielded
by
Aegon
the
Conqueror
himself
After
being
legitimized
he
took
the
formal
name
Daemon
Blackfyre
and
founded
the
Cadet
branch
of
House
Targaryen
known
as
House
Blackfyre
Aegon
IVs
trueborn
son
succeeded
to
the
throne
as
King
Daeron
II
Targaryen
Over
the
next
six
generations
House
Blackfyre
would
launch
repeated
attempts
to
seize
the
throne
from
the
main
branch
of
the
Targaryen
family
As
a
result
all
subsequent
generations
of
House
Blackfyre
descended
from
Daena
and
Aegon
III
as
well
as
Aegon
IV
albeit
as
legitimized
bastards
Some
even
pointed
out
that
had
the
succession
laws
not
changed
Daena
would
have
inherited
the
throne
ahead
of
her
uncle
Viserys
II
Meanwhile
subsequent
generations
of
the
main
Targaryen
family
descend
from
Aegon
IV
and
Viserys
II
but
not
from
Viserys
IIs
older
brother
Aegon
III
The
Blackfyres
and
their
supporters
felt
this
gave
them
a
superior
claim
to
the
throne
while
the
main
Targaryen
family
Daeron
II
and
his
descendants
held
that
it
did
not
due
to
Daemons
status
as
a
legitimized
bastard

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
is
a
formerly
exiled
Northern
lord
from
Westeros
previously
living
in
Essos
He
has
sworn
fealty
to
his
fellow
exile
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
was
the
first
to
help
her
adapt
to
life
as
a
Khaleesi
of
the
Dothraki
Originally
Jorah
was
working
as
a
spy
for
Varys
King
Roberts
spymaster
in
Kings
Landing
sending
Varys
information
about
the
Targaryen
exiles
But
he
grows
to
respect
and
admire
Daenerys
and
begins
serving
her
in
earnest
He
saves
her
from
an
assassination
attempt
stops
sending
reports
to
Varys
and
ignores
an
official
royal
pardon
that
would
allow
him
to
return
home
to
Westeros
He
develops
strong
and
unrequited
feelings
for
her
When
Daenerys
learns
of
his
past
spying
he
is
dismissed
from
her
service
and
ordered
to
leave
her
presence
He
later
capturesTyrion
Lannisterin
the
hope
of
winning
his
way
back
to
her
an
endeavor
that
leads
to
him
contracting
the
deadly
greyscale
After
he
helps
save
her
life
from
both
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
and
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
accepts
him
back
to
her
service
and
orders
him
to
come
back
to
her
after
he
finds
a
cure
to
his
disease
which
he
eventually

caught
and
disgraced
He
was
stripped
of
his
Lordship
and
fled
to
the
Free
Cities
to
avoid
being
executed
by
Eddard
Stark
though
he
left
his
familys
ancestral
sword
Longclaw
behind
his
father
would
eventually
pass
it
on
to
Jon
Snow
He
served
in
mercenary
companies
such
as
the
Golden
Company
His
wife
eventually
left
him
for
another
richer
man
He
is
called
Jorah
the
Andal
by
the
Dothraki
as
they
assume
that
all
people
from
Westeros
are
Andals
However
Jorah
is
actually
a
Northman
descended
from
the
First
Men
Besides
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros
Ser
Jorah
is
fluent
in
the
Dothraki
language
Season
Daenerys
and
Jorah
Mormont
in
the
Dothraki
sea
Jorah
appears
at
the
wedding
of
Khal
Drogo
and
Daenerys
Targaryen
He
introduces
himself
and
presents
Daenerys
with
some
books
containing
songs
and
stories
from
Westeros
He
tells
her
that
he
served
her
father
for
many
years
and
pledges
to
serve
the
rightful
king
her
brother
Viserys
While
traveling
to
Vaes
Dothrak
Ser
Jorah
tells
Viserys
that
he
lost
his
home
because
he
sold
some
poachers
to
slavers
which
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Eddard
Stark
wanted
to
execute
him
for
breaking
the
law
He
fled
instead
Viserys
dismisses
the
charges
as
foolishness
saying
such
things
will
be
tolerated
under
his
rule
Mormont
is
less
certain
that
this
will
happen
Ser
Jorah
is
impressed
by
Daeneryss
growing
ability
to
command
When
Viserys
tries
to
hit
Daenerys
she
is
defended
by
her
bodyguard
Rakharo
who
asks
her
if
she
wants
Viserys
killed
She
commands
that
no
harm
come
to
him
Viserys
orders
Ser
Jorah
to
kill
Daenerys
men
a
suicidal
order
that
Jorah
pointedly
ignores
from
this
point
on
he
is
under
Daeneryss
command
Rakharo
orders
Viseryss
horse
taken
so
he
has
to
walk
a
disgrace
for
a
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Rakharo
debate
combat
techniques
Jorah
talks
to
Rakharo
and
helps
him
learn
some
Westerosi
words
to
better
serve
her
Jorah
and
Rakharo
also
swap
their
opinions
on
the
value
of
swords
and
armors
versus
the
arakh
and
some
personal
information
Jorah
states
that
his
father
is
a
man
of
great
honor
and
integrity
and
that
Jorahs
disgrace
betrayed
him
When
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
he
rides
to
the
nearby
Free
City
of
Qohor
It
is
later
revealed
that
he
sent
information
to
Varys
in
Kings
Landing
about
Daeneryss
pregnancy
Arriving
at
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
asks
Jorah
if
he
thinks
the
Dothraki
could
retake
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
her
House
Mormont
points
out
the
difficulties
of
persuading
them
to
cross
the
Narrow
Sea
but
believes
success
would
be
possible
if
that
could
be
accomplished
and
if
King
Robert
was
foolish
enough
to
meet
them
in
open
battle
He
says
that
if
their
opponents
retreated
behind
stone
walls
the
Dothraki
would
not
be
able
to
root
them
out
They
move
to
discussing
Jorahs
background
and
he
admits
to
selling
the
poachers
as
slaves
to
raise
money
for
his
expensive
wife
When
Daenerys
asks
him
where
his
wife
is
Jorah
replies
that
she
is
with
another
man
in
another
place
Jorah
warning
Viserys
In
Kings
Landing
Eddard
Stark
learns
that
Jorah
Mormont
is
Varyss
agent
and
spy
in
Daeneryss
retinue
He
puts
little
faith
in
Jorahs
information
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
considering
him
a
traitor
who
will
say
anything
for
a
royal
pardon
However
King
Robert
and
his
council
are
adamant
that
his
information
can
be
relied
on
and
order
the
assassination
of
Daenerys
Jorah
translates
for
the
benefit
of
Viserys
during
the
ceremony
where
Daenerys
eats
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
Dosh
khaleen
can
prophesize
about
her
baby
Viserys
thinks
it
is
disgusting
but
when
he
realizes
that
the
Dothraki
love
Daenerys
he
slips
away
Jorah
follows
and
finds
him
trying
to
steal
Daeneryss
three
dragon
eggs
He
is
tired
of
waiting
and
he
wants
to
sell
the
eggs
to
buy
an
army
Viserys
accuses
Jorah
of
having
desires
for
his
sister
but
Jorah
still
stops
him
from
leaving
using
a
variation
of
the
motto
of
his
house
Yet
here
I
stand
Viserys
backs
down
and
leaves
without
the
eggs
Later
when
Viserys
threatens
Daenerys
Jorah
tries
to
stop
him
as
drawing
blood
in
the
sacred
city
is
punishable
by
death
When
Drogo
executes
Viserys
with
a
pot
of
molten
gold
he
urges
Daenerys
to
look
away
but
she
refuses

Jorah
accompanies

her
handmaidens
to
the
market
He
receives
a
message
from
a
lad
one
of
Varyss
informers
that
he
calls
his
Little
Birds
who
says
the
Spider
sends
his
regards
and
hands
him
a
parchment
which
he
says
is
his
pardon
and
he
can
go
home
now
Ser
Jorah
clutches
it
and
looks
at
it
with
longing
but
realizes
it
means
that
if
they
dont
need
anyone
to
spy
on
Daenerys
anymore
she
is
likely
in
danger
He
goes
back
to
the
market
and
seeing
a
wineseller
trying
to
give
Daenerys
a
cask
as
a
gift
he
intervenes
and
prevents
the
assassination
as
the
wine
is
poisoned
Drogo

his

if

Daenerys
is
shocked
to
learn
that
her

son
will
be
killed
in
the
resulting

to
succeed
Drogo
Jorah
suggests
they
leave
quietly
and
try
to
get
to
Asshai
where
there
is
a
port
but
Daenerys
refuses
She
begs
the
Lhazareen
witch
Mirri
Maz
Duur
to
help
Drogo
with
blood
magic
and
tells
Ser
Jorah
that
he
should
put
on
his
armor
When
Drogos
bloodrider
Qotho
tries
to
halt
the
ceremony
Ser
Jorah
stops
him
with
his
sword
They
fight
and
the
younger

swiftly
gains
the
upper
hand
through

his
arakh
is
unable
to
penetrate
Jorahs
heavy
armor
allowing
Jorah
to
kill
him
Daenerys
goes
into

are
too
afraid
to

cursed
because

the
maegi
Jorah
takes
her
into

to
seek

is
with

she
insists
on

and
her
child
She
learns
that
her
son
was
stillborn
badly
malformed
and
that
Drogo
is
alive

comatose
while
the

has
scattered

dragon
eggs
placed
on
the
pyre
and
has
Jorah
bind
Duur
to
the
pyre
so
that
she
may
burn
alive
Ser
Jorah
tries
to
stop
Daenerys
from
burning
the
dragon
eggs
as
they
can
be
sold
to
buy
her
a
life
of
travel
to
exotic
places
He
tells
her
he
knows
she
is
planning
on
stepping
onto
the
pyre
as
well
and
says
she
must
not
She
strokes
his
cheek
and
gives
a
speech
to
her
people
saying
that
they
may
go
but
if
they
stay
she
will
lead
them
to
a

she
wonders
where

what
can
she
do
against
starvation
Jorah
reminds
her
that
returning
either
to
Lhazar
or
to
the
Dothraki

would
mean
their
death
and
the
loss
of
her
dragons
at

He

He
is
also
with

when
Kraznys
mo
Nakloz
demonstrates
the
level
of
obedience
of
his
Unsullied
soldiers
by
slicing
off
one
of
their
nipples
and
urges
her
to
purchase
them
During
the
conversation
Daenerys
finds
herself
distracted
by
a
young
girl
playing
with
a
ball
A
cloaked
stranger
appears
from
behind
them
to
knock
the
ball
out
of
her
hands
and
Jorah
engages
in
a
struggle
with
him
The
ball
hits
the
floor
and
cracks
open
to
reveal
a
manticore
which
the
stranger
promptly
stabs
with
his
dagger
When
he
removes
his
hood

merits
of
buying
the
Unsullied
Barristan
advises
Daenerys
that
there
is
no
honor
in
conquering
with
a
purchased
slave
army
Jorah
counters
that
honor
does
not
win
battles
and
that
the
Unsullied
are
not
like
a
regular
army
They
will
not
rape
and
pillage
and
will
only
kill
who
they
are
ordered
to
kill
Daenerys
eventually
offers
one
of
her
dragons
to
Kraznys
in
return
for
all
of
his
Unsullied
a
deal
that
Jorah
and
Barristan
both
strongly
advise
her
against
Nevertheless
Daenerys
stands
her
ground
and
scolds
her
two
advisors
for
contradicting
her
in
public
Jorah
is
present
at
the
Sack
of
Astapor
where
Daenerys
manages
to
both
keep
all
of
her
dragons
and
win
the
army
as
well
as
their
trust
in
her
as
a
queen
and
not
as
a
mistress
effectively
getting
the
best
out
of
both
Jorah
and
Barristans
prior
arguments
On
the
road
north
to
Yunkai
Jorah
reminisces
with

about
the
day
he
was
knighted
by
King
Robert
for
his
part
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
He
recalls
that
the
only
thing
on
his
mind
was
how
badly
he
needed
to
urinate
having
been
sealed
in
armor
for
sixteen
hours
Barristan
prods
Jorah
about
his
past
when
he
was
disgraced
and
exiled
for
his
involvement
in
the
slave
trade
and
warns
him
that
his
presence
alongside
Daenerys
may
harm
her
image
in
Westeros
Jorah
questions
Barristan
about
the
advisors
on
King
Roberts
Small
Council
subtly
trying
to
ascertain
whether
Barristan
knows
that
he
was
previously
spying
on
Daenerys
for
Varys
However
Barristan
explains
that
as
a
former
Targaryen
loyalist
King
Robert
did
not
fully
trust
him
and
excluded
him
from
council
meetings
Jorah
and
Barristan
briefly
bicker
about
the
fact
that
Barristan
has
only
just
arrived
while
Jorah
has
been
protecting
Daenerys
for
months
Jorah
tells
Barristan
that
he
is
not
Lord
Commander
here
and
he
only
takes
orders
from
Daenerys
Upon
arriving
at
Yunkais
gates
Jorah
is
dismissive
of
Daeneryss
and
Barristans
claims
that
its
reputation
for
training
bed
slaves
rather
than
soldiers
will
give
them
a
clear
advantage
and
explains
that
Yunkai
will
in
all
likelihood
just
shut
its
gates
and
chip
away
at
Daeneryss
army
using
guerilla
tactics
He
also
advises
Dany
that
conquering
Yunkai
is
irrelevant
in
their
quest
to
return
to
Westeros
but
she
is
adamant
on
freeing
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
slaves
within
the
city
walls
Jorah
is
present
in
Daeneryss
tent
when
the
Yunkish
slavetrader
Razdal
mo
Eraz
arrives
bearing
gifts
Following
her
orders
he
spies
on
the
mercenary
group
the
Second
Sons
and
is
again
present
in
her
tent
when
she
is
hosting
the
two
mercenary
captains
Mero
and
Prendahl
na
Ghezn
and
their
lieutenant
Daario
Naharis
Mero
is
sexually
vulgar
towards
Daenerys
which
prompts
Ser
Jorah
to
threaten
him
to
mind
his
tongue
With
Daarios
help
Jorah
and
Grey
Worm
enter
Yunkai
from
one
of
its
posterior
tunnels
and
the
three
of
them
successfully
fight
off
a
number
of
guards
and
open
the
gates
of
Yunkai
from
the
inside
allowing
the
Unsullied
to
sweep
in
and
win
the
city
for
Daenerys
Jorah
however
is
noticably
distraught
when
all
of
Daeneryss
postvictory
attention
is
centered
on
Daario
Jorah
along
with
Ser
Barristan
Daario
and
Missandei
is
also
present
when
Daenerys
is
greeted
with
open
arms
by
the
newly
freed
slaves
of
Yunkai
Season
While
feeding
her
dragons
Dany
is
warned
by
Jorah
once
again
about
the
fact
that
they
are
not
tameable
beasts
He
also
informs
her
that
Daario
Naharis
and
Grey
Worm
are
gambling
When
the
army
of
Unsullied
halts
in
unison
Jorah
faces
the
crucifixion
of
a
small
child
one
of
along
the
path
to
Meereen
greatest
of
the
cities
of
Slavers
Bay
As
the
one
who
has
been
at
her
side
the
longest
Ser
Jorah
volunteers
to
face
the
champion
sent
out
by
Meereen
when
Daenerys
arrives
at
their
gates
Daenerys
refuses
to
gamble
with
the
life
of
her
most
trusted
advisor
general
and
dearest
friend
Ser
Jorah
is
confronted
by
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
regarding
Mormonts
royal
pardon
Ser
Jorah
informs
Daenerys
that
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
has
been
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
He
also
informs
her
of
the
disasters
in
the
two
cities
she
liberated
Yunkai
and
Astapor
Daeneryss
companions
debate
about
possibly
mounting
an
invasion
of
Westeros
due
to
its
current
state
Jorah
is
against
it
stating
that
their
forces
could
not
conquer
all
of
Westeros
alone
and
they
have
no
real
allies
on
the
continent
After
Daenerys
dismisses
the
rest
of
her
council
she
tells
Jorah
that
her
business
in
Slavers
Bay
is
not
yet
complete
and
intends
to
stay
Some
weeks
later
Jorah
enters
Daeneryss
chambers
early
in
the
morning
and
is
not
pleased
to
find
a
partiallydressed
Daario
exiting
Daario
quips
that
it
is
a
good
time
to
petition
Daenerys
because
she
is
in
a
very
good
mood
Entering
the
queens
conference
room
he
expresses
his
distrust
for
Daario
insinuating
that
Daario
only
murdered
his
superiors
and
joined
forces
with
Daenerys
out
of
lust
and
thus
is
not
a
trustworthy
ally
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
she
sent
Daario
to
take
the
Second
Sons
to
Yunkai
to
regain
control
over
the
city
and
kill
the
masters
that
have
resurfaced
Jorah
relates
to
the
mercy
shown
by
Eddard
Stark
for
his
dealings
in
slavery
and
convinces
Daenerys
to
bring
the
masters
to
justice
without
execution
Daenerys
considers
for
a
moment
and
then
tells
Jorah
to
assign
Hizdahr
zo
Loraq
as
her
ambassador
to
offer
the
masters
a
choice
they
can
live
free
in
the
new
world
she
wants
to
create
or
they
can
die
clinging
to
their
old
one
The
Second
Sons
will
be
stationed
in
Yunkai
to
enforce
whichever
choice
the
masters
make
She
also
says
to
let
Daario
know
that
it
was
Jorah
who
changed
her
mind
Daenerys
banishes
Ser
Jorah
from
her
service
As
Barristan
Selmy
watches
the
Unsullied
taking
down
the
crucified
slave
masters
outside
of
Meereen
a
small
boy
approaches
him
giving
him
a
scroll
bearing
the
seal
of
the
kings
hand
As
Barristan
reads
it
he
realizes
that
the
letter
was
signed
by
Robert
Baratheon
the
same
year
Jorah
and
Daenerys
first
met
each
other
Barristan
confronts
Jorah
about
this
before
telling
Daenerys
saying
that
he
doesnt
want
to
go
behind
Jorahs
back
He
tells
Jorah
that
he
knows
the
truth
Jorah
was
intially
working
as
a
spy
for
Robert
As
Jorah
asks
to
speak
with
Daenerys
alone
Barristan
tells
him
you
will
never
be
alone
with
her
again
In
the
throne
room
as
Jorah
walks
up
the
steps
towards
Daenerys
the
tension
mounts
when
she
asks
for
an
explanation
Jorah
explains
that
the
situation
is
a
ploy
by
TywinLannister
in
order
to
divide
them
However
as
the
scroll
was
signed
the
year
Jorah
first
met
Daenerys
she
asks
if
the
pardon
was
forged
Reluctantly
Jorah
tells
the
truth
at
Daeneryss
request
He
confesses
to
providing
the
spider
the
information
on
Daeneryss
activities
in
Essos
Ser
Jorah
leaves
Meereen
Daenerys
gets
angry
when
Jorah
also
admits
that
he
provided
the
information
of
her
pregnancy
with
Drogos
child
as
it
led
to
her
nearly
getting
poisoned
by
the
wine
merchant
outside
of
VaesDothrak
Jorah
defensively
tells
her
that
if
it
hadnt
been
for
him
she
would
have
been
poisoned
but
she
counters
that
was
only
because
he
saw
it
coming
Jorah
calls
her
name
and
begs
for
her
forgiveness
but
she
rejects
saying
that
he
sold
all
her
secrets
to
Robert
the
man
whom
she
finds
guilty
of
her
familys
murder
Jorah
is
forced
to
leave
the
city
within
the
day
or
have
his
head
thrown
into
the
Slavers
Bay
Jorah
then
leaves
Meereen
Season
Ser
Jorah
kidnaps
Tyrion
intending
to
take
him
to
Daenerys
Jorah
resurfaces
in
Volantis
drinking
in
a
brothel
and
shamefully
eyeing
a
whore
dressed
as
Daenerys
From
afar
he
recognizes
Tyrion
Lannister
and
Varys
Jorah
later
approaches
Tyrion
while
he
is
urinating
alone
and
binds
him
with
rope
and
gags
him
telling
Tyrion
that
he
is
taking
him
to
the
Queen
With
Tyrion
captive
Jorah
steals
a
small
boat
and
begins
to
sail
east
towards
Meereen
En
route
Tyrion
pesters
Jorah
with
muffled
whining
until
he
relents
and
removes
Tyrions
gag
Tyrion
notices
that
they
are
traveling
east
and
not
west
towards
Cersei
in
Kings
Landing
Jorah
reveals
that
he
is
taking
Tyrion
to
the
queen
he
serves
Daenerys
Targaryen
Tyrion
is
pleasantly
surprised
and
tries
to
convince
him
that
they
are
on
the
same
side
since
he
was
traveling
to
meet
Daenerys
anyway
He
also
accurately
deduces
who
Jorah
is
by
his
appearance
and
equipment
He
also
correctly
assumes
that
Jorah
must
have
been
banished
by
Daenerys
because
she
discovered
that
he
was
spying
on
her
for
Varys
Tyrion
mockingly
asks
Jorah
if
he
really
believes
that
he
will
earn
a
pardon
for
simply
delivering
him
to
Daenerys
alternately
she
might
pardon
Tyrion
and
behead
Jorah
instead
Fed
up
with
his
captive
Jorah
knocks
Tyrion
across
the
face
leaving
him
unconscious
Ser
Jorah
notices
that
his
wrist
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
As
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
their
journey
Tyrion
continues
to
mock
House
Mormont
as
well
as
Bear
Island
Eventually
the
two
find
Old
Valyria
and
passes
through
its
ruins
to
find
Meereen
While
sailing
through
the
ruins
the
two
look
in
astonishment
as
they
see
Drogon
fly
past
them
In
a
quick
turn
of
events
men
infected
with
Greyscale
appear
and
attack
the
two
Jorah
manages
to
fight
them
off
but
Tyrion
is
pulled
underwater
When
Tyrion
wakes
up
he
finds
himself
on
shore
saved
by
Jorah
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
but
Jorah
looks
at
his
wrists
and
notices
he
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
towards
Meereen
on
foot
having
failed
to
acquire
a
boat
During
conversation
Tyrion
mentions
to
Jorah
that
he
knew
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
from
his
trip
to
the
Wall
and
reveals
that
he
was
killed
by
his
own
men
in
a
mutiny
while
returning
from
a
great
ranging
leaving
Jorah
visibly
saddened
at
his
fathers
death
Jorah
is
also
pressed
by
Tyrion
for
information
as
to
why
he
is
serving
Daenerys
in
the
first
place
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
captured
by
slavers
Jorah
tells
him
that
he
grew
to
truly
believe
in
her
when
he
saw
her
emerge
from
Khal
Drogos
funeral
pyre
unscathed
with
three
dragon
hatchlings
and
that
she
also
has
a
birthright
to
the
throne
even
though
Tyrion
mentions
the
infamous
Targaryen
madness
that
may
surface
in
her
later
in
life
However
they
are
found
and
captured
by
slavers
The
leader
Malko
plans
to
sell
them
in
Volantis
but
Tyrion
convinces
them
to
allow
Jorah
to
participate
in
the
fighting
pits
in
Meereen
to
make
them
rich
offering
the
information
that
Jorah
once
unseated
Jaime
Lannister
in
a
jousting
match
When
Malko
scoffs
this
Jorah
brings
up
that
he
slew
Qotho
in
single
combat
inciting
Malkos
interest
and
convincing
him
to
take
them
to
Meereen
On
the
outskirts
of
Meereen
Jorah
is
put
on
auction
by
Malko
who
exaggerates
Jorahs
accomplishments
by
claiming
that
along
with
fighting
alongside
The
Stag
King
he
took
part
in
the
attack
on
Spike
with
his
flaming
sword
when
it
was
really
Thoros
of
Myr
singlehandedly
killed
Khal
Drogo
and
was
betrayed
by
his
wife
and
willingly
sold
into
slavery
in
order
to
repay
his
debts
A
slaver
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
buys
Jorah
and
Tyrion
as
well
when
Tyrion
convinces
him
They
are
taken
to
one
of
the
fighting
pits
and
when
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
present
for
the
opening
of
the
games
he
takes
a
sword
and
enters
the
arena
knocking
out
the
other
fighters
while
disguised
with
a
helmet
Jorah
approaches
Daenerys
and
removes
his
helmet
to
reveal
his
identity
but
Daenerys
who
still
hasnt
forgiven
him
orders
Jorah
to
be
taken
away
Jorah
informs
her
that
he
has
brought
a
gift
and
Tyrion
reveals
himself
meeting
Daenerys
facetoface
at
last
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
brought
before
Daenerys
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Back
in
Meereen
Daenerys
after
learning
Tyrion
wants
to
advise
her
asks
him
what
he
thinks
she
should
do
with
Jorah
Tyrion
tells
her
how
devoted
Jorah
seemed
to
be
to
her
and
that
he
did
not
think
she
would
be
wise
enough
to
forgive
him
He
then
tells
her
how
killing
people
devoted
to
her
is
not
a
ruler
who
inspires
devotion
and
that
she
would
need
lots
of
it
if
she
was
ever
going
to
rule
Westeros
but
when
she
did
he
couldnt
be
by
her
side
Daenerys
then
orders
Jorah
removed
from
the
city
once
more
Jorah
with
his
Greyscale
slowly
progressing
returns
to
the
fighting
pits
where
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
remains
Since
he
won
the
earlier
match
Jorah
demanded
that
he
fight
at
the
great
pit
in
front
of
the
queen
Jorah
says
he
is
the
best
he
has
and
that
if
he
wins
he
will
belong
to
Yezzan
Jorah
later
joins
the
Great
Games
in
Daznaks
Pit
in
front
of
the
queen
along
with
a
Water
Dancer
from
Braavos
a
Dothraki
warrior
a
Summer
Islander
with
a
halberd
a
Meereenese
champion
wielding
a
spear
and
another
fighter
When
Daenerys
recognizes
Jorah
she
is
visibly
distraught
and
as
the
fighting
continues
and
Jorah
is
severely
wounded
by
the
water
dancer
Tyrion
reminds
Daenerys
that
she
could
stop
the
fight
at
any
moment
to
save
Jorah
Ser
Jorah
fighting
in
the
Great
Pit
of
Daznak
Even
though
the
fear
is
clearly
shown
on
her
face
Daenerys
refuses
Jorah
manages
to
win
the
fight
despite
being
outmatched
during
most
of
it
Just
as
the
fight
ends
Jorah
throws
a
spear
towards
Daenerys
who
believing
the
spear
was
meant
for
her
ducks
out
of
the
way
The
spear
is
revealed
to
be
meant
for
a
Son
of
the
Harpy
who
was
sneaking
up
behind
her
Much
of
the
audience
reveals
themselves
to
be
Sons
of
the
Harpy
proceeding
to
kill
everyone
they
can
Jorah
joins
the
ensuing
battle
for
Daenerys
and
tries
to
help
escort
her
out
of
the
fighting
pit
but
they
eventually
end
up
surrounded
and
vastly
outnumbered
At
that
moment
Drogon
appears
in
the
arena
and
starts
killing
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
and
scaring
off
the
rest
Jorah
Tyrion
Daario
and
Missandei
all
observe
in
awe
as
Daenerys
flies
off
on
Drogon
Back
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Tyrion
addresses
both
Jorah
and
Daarios
feelings
for
Daenerys
understanding
how
one
could
love
the
wrong
woman
The
three
argue
about
Jorahs
betrayal
but
they
will
not
make
any
judgments
without
Daenerys
first
Jorah
Tyrion
and
Daario
plan
their
next
move
The
dragon
was
seen
taking
her
north
and
it
is
agreed
that
Jorah
will
join
Daario
to
ride
and
search
for
her
Grey
Worm
still
recovering
from
his
injuries
offers
to
go
with
them
as
does
Tyrion
Daario
firmly
nixes
both
ideas
Grey
Worm
is
needed
to
command
the
Unsullied
in
keeping
the
city
under
control
while
Tyrion
is
the
only
one
of
them
to
have
any
political
experience
Thus
Daario
and
Jorah
depart
together
hoping
to
find
their
Queen
in
the
Dothraki
Sea
Season
Jorah
and
Daario
search
for
Dany
Jorah
and
Daario
follow
Drogons
trail
into
the
Dothraki
sea
where
Daario
gets
him
to
admit
he
is
in
love
with
Daenerys
While
Daario
isnt
looking
Jorah
examines
the
spreading
greyscale
on
his
arm
to
determine
how
long
he
has
left
to
live
They
eventually
discover
a
circle
of
hoof
prints
where
Jorah
finds
Daeneryss
ring
in
the
middle
leading
them
to
realize
a
Dothraki
khalasar
has
taken
her
captive
Jorah
and
Daario
make
their
way
to
Vaes
Dothrak
with
Daario
taunting
Jorah
about
how
Daenerys
chose
him
as
her
lover
Jorah
scans
the
city
and
deduces
that
Daenerys
has
been
taken
to
the
temple
of
the
dosh
khaleen
Jorah
and
Daario
leave
their
weapons
outside
the
city
and
Daario
notices
Jorahs
greyscale
Jorah
assures
Daario
that
he
was
not
infected
The
two
sneak
into
the
city
at
night
and
are
caught
by
two
Dothraki
Jorah
tries
to
pass
off
himself
and
Daario
as
lost
merchants
but
the
Dothraki
see
through
the
ruse
After
killing
them
Jorah
and
Daario
find
Daenerys
and
offer
to
help
her
escape
the
city
but
she
enlists
them
in
her
plan
to
take
control
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Daario
kill
the
guards
outside
the
temple
in
which
the
khals
are
determining
Daeneryss
fate
and
bar
the
door
resulting
in
the
khals
being
unable
to
escape
when
Daenerys
sets
the
temple
ablaze
When
Daenerys
emerges
from
the
inferno
unburnt
Jorah
and
Daario
bow
before
her
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
shows
Daenerys
his
greyscale
sickness
The
next
day
overlooking
the
smoldering
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
Daenerys
confronts
Jorah
She
reminds
him
that
she
has
banished
him
twice
but
remembers
that
he
has
twice
returned
and
has
saved
her
life
As
she
ponders
what
to
do
Jorah
interjects
that
she
must
send
him
away
revealing
his
greyscale
He
explains
that
he
does
not
know
of
a
cure
or
how
long
the
disease
takes
but
that
he
will
end
things
before
he
becomes
a
stone
man
himself
Jorah
then
tells
Daenerys
that
Tyrion
Lannister
was
right
about
him
he
loves
her
and
will
always
love
her
and
begins
to
leave
Daenerys
stops
him
and
rather
than
dismissing
him
tearfully
orders
Jorah
to
go
and
find
a
cure
for
his
disease
so
that
he
may
be
by
her
side
when
she
takes
back
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Jorah
and
Dany
then
part
on
good
terms
as
he
watches
her
lead
her
new
khalasar
out
of
Vaes
Dothrak
before
embarking
on
his
own
new
quest
Season
Sam
performs
a
risky
treatment
on
Jorah
to
cure
him
of
his
greyscale
Jorah
has
traveled
to
Oldtown
seeking
a
cure
for
his
greyscale
but
has
been
placed
inside
one
of
the
sick
cells
in
the
Citadel
As
Samwell
Tarly
is
collecting
empty
bowls
from
cells
Jorah
reaches
out
for
him
his
infection
having
spread
rapidly
and
asks
if
Daenerys
has
reached
Westeros
yet
but
Sam
claims
he
does
not
know
Jorah
is
later
deemed
beyond
saving
by
Archmaester
Ebrose
and
is
told
that
he
has
one
more
day
before
he
will
be
deported
to
the
Valyrian
Peninsula
to
live
out
the
rest
of
his
days
with
the
stone
men
as
the
greyscale
will
take
over
his
mind
in
six
months
Within
that
time
he
still
seeks
to
end
his
own
life
before
then
He
properly
introduces
himself
to
Samwell
explaining
that
there
is
no
point
writing
to
Lyanna
Mormont
as
House
Mormont
forgot
about
him
a
long
time
ago
Jorah
returns
to
Dany
Later
that
night
as
Jorah
writes
a
farewell
note
to
Daenerys
he
is
visited
by
Sam
who
claims
that
out
of
respect
for
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
he
will
try
to
save
him
from
his
greyscale
though
he
admits
he
has
never
tried
before
and
is
the
only
one
who
will
despite
it
being
risky
for
both
Sam
and
Jorah
Aware
of
the
alternative
Jorah
consents
to
the
treatment
He
is
given
rum
as
anesthesia
and
a
mouthguard
to
bite
on
during
the
painful
procedure
to
stay
silent
Bearing
the
pain
Jorah
allows
Sam
to
start
peeling
his
infected
skin
away
With
his
greyscale
now
cured
by
Samwell
Ebrose
allows
the
release
of
Jorah
from
his
cell
When
Ebrose
asks
of
the
disease
Jorah
says
it
must
have
cured
itself
from
having
plenty
of
rest
Before
Jorah
leaves
he
tells
Sam
he
will
return
to
Daenerys
that
both
she
and
Sam
has
saved
his
life
Jorah
shakes
Sams
hand
in
gratitude
before
leaving
After
leaving
the
Citadel
Jorah
makes
his
way
to
Dragonstone
where
he
is
finally
reunited
with
Daenerys
who
gladly
accepts
him
back
into
her
service
and
calls
him
a
friend
He
also
meets
Jon
Snow
who
served
under
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
in
the
Nights
Watch
Jorah
later
attends
a
meeting
during
which
Tyrion
Lannister
suggests
that
they
should
capture
a
wight
and
bring
it
to
Cersei
Lannister
thus
proving
that
the
army
of
the
dead
is
marching
upon
Westeros
and
allowing
Daenerys
to
take
her
troops
to
help
Jon
Jorah
volunteers
to
join
the
mission
and
leaves
Dragonstone
with
Jon
Davos
Seaworth
and
Gendry
Upon
arriving
at
EastwatchbytheSea
Jorah
quickly
recognizes
the
imprisoned
Thoros
of
Myr
having
fought
together
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
Unfortunately
the
mention
of
Jorahs
family
name
creates
friction
with
Tormund
due
to
Jeor
Mormonts
role
in
persecuting
the
wildlings
Nevertheless
Jorah
accompanies
the
party
north
of
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Jon
to
keep
Longclaw
Once
beyond
the
Wall
Jorah
discusses
his
fathers
death
with
Jon
Snow
stating
that
being
killed
by
his
own
men
was
the
worst
way
for
Jeor
to
pass
away
They
also
discuss
the
fact
that
Ned
Stark
wanted
to
execute
Jorah
and
Jon
offers
to
give
Longclaw
back
to
House
Mormont
However
Jorah
refuses
as
he
brought
shame
on
his
family
he
has
no
longer
the
right
to
wield
the
weapon
which
must
remain
with
Jon
as
Jeor
wanted
Later
the
party
is
attacked
by
an
undead
bear
which
severely
injures
Thoros
before
Jorah
kills
the
beast
with
a
final
strike
Jorah
and
Thoros
then
discuss
the
Siege
of
Pyke
with
Thoros
acknowledging
that
he
was
so
drunk
that
day
that
he
completely
forgot
the
battle
Jorah
assists
in
subduing
a
wight
The
party
finally
encounters
a
small
group
of
wights
led
by
a
White
Walker
They
attack
it
and
Jorah
is
assaulted
by
a
wight
who
tries
to
choke
him
to
death
before
being
shattered
when
Jon
kills
the
White
Walker
leading
them
They
successfully
capture
an
undead
but
it
draw
the
attention
of
the
whole
undead
army
which
rushed
at
them
While
Gendry
returns
to
Eastwatch
to
send
a
raven
to
Daenerys
Jorah
and
the
others
find
refuge
on
a
small
island
in
the
middle
of
the
frozen
lake
that
the
wights
cannot
cross
They
spend
the
night
on
the
rocks
to
which
Thoros
does
not
survive
and
are
later
attacked
by
the
army
of
the
Night
King
as
the
ice
layer
over
the
water
is
solid
enough
Jorah
fights
along
the
others
with
a
pair
of
dragonglass
daggers
destroying
many
wights
but
the
party
is
easily
outnumbered
and
only
survives
thanks
to
the
arrival
of
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
Jorah
is
shocked
and
saddened
when
he
witnesses
the
death
of
Daenerys
youngest
dragon
Viserion
at
the
hands
of
the
Night
King
The
survivors
manage
to
escape
except
Jon
Snow
who
is
taken
beneath
the
lake
by
wights
Back
to
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Daenerys
that
they
should
return
to
Kings
Landing
and
attends
Jons
return
to
Eastwatch
after
he
was
saved
by
Benjen
Stark
Jorah
during
the
negotiation
in
the
Dragonpit
Jorah
goes
to
Kings
Landing
to
attend
the
negotiation
between
Daenerys
Cersei
and
Jon
explaining
the
origins
of
the
Dragonpit
to
Missandei
on
the
way
They
are
greeted
by
Bronn
who
escorts
them
to
their
seats
with
Jorah
sitting
right
next
to
Daenerys
Jorah
does
not
speak
during
the
discussions
Like
everyone
else
he
is
surprised
when
Jon
openly
pledges
allegiance
to
Daenerys
and
stays
at
the
Dragonpit
while
Tyrion
tries
to
convince
Cersei
to
help
them
after
she
left
the
negotiation
After
Cersei
seemingly
agrees
to
send
troops
to
fight
the
army
of
the
Night
King
Jorah
leaves
Kings
Landing
with
the
others
and
make
his
way
to
the
North
Personality
Jorah
is
a
complex
character
as
he
isDaenerys
Targaryens
most
loyal
advisor
and
a
formidable
warrior
Jorah
has
a
deep
respect
loyalty
and
love
for
Daenerys
and
has
always
tried
to
give
her
reasonable
practical
and
effective
advice
While
Jorah
is
a
moral
person
and
always
tries
to
be
honorable
he
has
done
several
dishonorable
acts
out
of
love
or
for
his
own
survival
He
sold
poachers
into
slavery
to
pay
for
his
wifes
spending
habits
fled
Westeros
to
escape
executionand
briefly
spied
on
Daenerys
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
royal
pardon
though
he
stopped
spying
on
her
after
becoming
her
advisor
Jorah
is
Daeneryss
most
levelheaded
advisor
at
least
until
the
arrival
of
Barristan
Selmy
Jorah
is
intelligent
literate
and
well
travelled
knowing
the
histories
of
Essos
and
speaking
several
tongues
including
Dothraki
His
relationship
with
his
father
and
likely
the
rest
of
his
family
wasnt
approached
until
the
fifth
season
Although
he
never
showed
any
feelings
towards
Jeor
once
he
was
given
the
news
about
his
death
Jorah
was
visibly
shaken
and
deeply
upset
even
angrily
demanding
to
know
the
details
of
his
fathers
death
This
is
most
likely
because
he
was
still
feeling
guilty
about
bringing
his
family
shame
and
never
fully
reconciling
with
Jeor
Although
stoic
shortspoken
and
sometimes
cold
Jorah
does
have
the
ability
to
warm
up
to
people
once
they
earn
his
respect
At
first
he
treated
Tyrion
like
a
hostage
but
later
after
the
two
barely
survived
the
sinking
of
their
boat
he
started
to
trust
Tyrion
enough
to
leave
him
untied
and
later
the
two
men
shared
their
life
stories
and
freely
discussed
Daenerys
and
her
claim
to
the
throne
although
their
newfound
trust
was
shattered
when
Tyrion
convinced
Daenerys
to
exile
Jorah
from
Meereen
again
which
he
did
to
spare
him
Daeneryss
wrath
He
is
also
a
skilled
warrior
though
he
does
have
a
honor
code
and
tries
not
to
kill
his
opponent
if
such
option
is
possible
This
is
shown
in
the
fighting
pit
where
every
other
warrior
was
brutally
slaughtering
one
another
but
Jorah
came
victorious
without
any
loss
of
life
in
his
hands
This
worked
in
his
favor
since
he
was
aware
that
Daenerys
was
becoming
increasingly
appalled
by
the
needless
violence
happening
in
the
pit
right
before
Jorah
got
into
the
skirmish
And
even
after
using
brute
force
to
harm
another
person
he
does
seem
to
try
compensate
for
his
actions
as
he
did
give
some
money
to
a
knocked
out
fisherman
for
his
stolen
boat
Also
Jorah
has
an
immense
tolerance
for
pain
as
he
managed
to
stay
silent
during
Sams
procedure
to
cure
him
of
the
greyscale
even
though
the
Citadel
apprentice
was
effectively
cutting
bits
of
Jorahs
own
skin

his
own
past
and
family
He
also
narrates
Vaes
Dothrak
and
The
Dothraki
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Jorah
is
described
as
balding
and
hairy
but
still
fit
though
not
a
handsome
man
He
is
the
son
of
Lord
Jeor
Mormont
of
Bear
Island
He
won
honor
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
when
he
was
one
of
the
first
through
the
breach
during
the
storming
of
Pyke
For
his
valor
he
won
praise
from
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
a
knighthood
With
a
strong
vigorous
son
ready
to
take
over
the
lordship
Jeor
decided
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
where
he
rapidly
rose
to
the
rank
of
Lord
Commander
leaving
Jorah
as
Lord
of
Bear
Island
Jorahs
first
wife
was
an
unnamed
woman
of
House
Glover
who
was
unable
to
carry
a
child
to
term
in
ten
years
of
marriage
and
died
after
a
third
miscarriage
She
has
not
been
referred
to
in
the
TV
series
He
later
married
Lynesse
Hightower
of
the
extremely
powerful
House
Hightower
of
Oldtown
after
winning
a
tournament
to
celebrate
the
victory
of
King
Robert
against
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
in
which
Jorah
wore
Lynesses
favor
Lynesse
was
used
to
the
riches
and
luxury
of
the
secondlargest
city
in
Westeros
and
found
Bear
Island
primitive
and
crude
Jorahs
attempts
to
please
his
wife
led
to
him
spending
all
of
his
money
He
disgraced
himself
through
behavior
unbefitting
a
lord
by
arresting
poachers
and
selling
them
to
slavers
Slavery
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
has
been
for
millennia
When
Eddard
Stark
came
to
arrest
Jorah
he
and
Lynesse
fled
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
the
Free
City
of
Lys
leaving
his
aunt
Maege
to
become
the
ruling
Lady
of
Bear
Island
Jorah
attempted
to
make
his
living
as
a
sellsword
but
was
unable
to
provide
an
income
acceptable
to
Lynesse
She
left
him
and
became
a
concubine
to
the
merchant
lord
Tregar
Ormollen
who
then
exiled
Jorah
from
the
city
Daenerys
learns
of
Jorahs
past
spying
for
Varys
earlier
in
the
book
narrative
before
she
conquers
Meereen
Ser
Barristan
initially
conceals
his
true
identity
from
her
claiming
to
be
a
squire
named
Arstan
Whitebeard
this
storyline
was
omitted
from
the
TV
series
and
when
he
finally
reveals
himself
he
also
tells
her
of
Jorahs
treachery
which
Barristan
knew
from
attending
Roberts
small
council
meetings
in
the
series
Barristan
was
not
a
member
of
the
small
council
and
thus
he
knew
nothing
of
Jorahs
spying
She
initially
dismisses
both
and
assigns
them
a
suicide
mission
to
conquer
Meereen
by
entering
the
city
via
its
sewers
To
her
surprise
and
disappointment
both
survive
the
mission
and
help
her
capture
the
city
She
forgives
Ser
Barristan
and
readmits
him
into
her
service
She
intends
to
pardon
Jorah
too
but
is
angered
by
his
attitude
he
remains
defensive
and
lacks
contrition
when
she
thinks
he
ought
to
be
begging
for
her
forgiveness
so
she
dismisses
him
although
she
fights
back
tears
as
she
does
so
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
if
she
sees
him
again
she
will
order
Strong
Belwas
who
does
not
appear
in
the
TV
series
to
wrench
his
head
off
Daario
Naharis
offers
to
kill
Jorah
for
her
but
Daenerys
decides
to
spare
him
and
he
is
allowed
to
leave
the
city
Daario
warns
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
kill
Jorah
or
otherwise
keep
him
close
There
is
no
mentioning
in
the
books
that
Jorah
ever
served
in
the
Golden
Company
though
it
is
said
that
after
Lynesse
left
him
he
scraped
by
as
a
sellsword
for
years
until
he
came
to
Pentos
to
spy
on
the
Targaryens
At
first
he
fought
as
a
sellsword
for
Lys
but
after
Lynesses
new
lover
exiled
him
from
the
city
he
drifted
to
Volantis
where
he
spent
the
better
part
of
a
year
working
as
a
sellsword
and
owning
nothing
but
his
sword
Jorah
is
never
attacked
by
Stone
Men
or
infected
with
Greyscale
Instead
Tyrion
was
attacked
by
Stone
Men
earlier
in
his
journeyin
the
ruins
of
Chroyane
instead
of
Valyria
It
is
a
man
named
Griff
one
of
Tyrions
companions
at
the
time
who
gets
infected
with
Greyscale
instead
Jorah
Tyrion
and
their
dwarf
companion
board
a
ship
at
Volantis
heading
for
Qarth
The
ship
is
badly
damaged
in
a
storm
After
drifting
for
at
least
nineteen
days
slavers
from
Yunkai
appear
Tyrion
and
all
the
rest
of
the
passangers
yield
without
fight
but
Jorah
resists
fiercely
and
kills
three
of
the
slavers
before
he
is
overcome
As
a
result
the
slavers
treat
him
much
more
harshly
than
their
other
captives
he
has
been
chained
to
an
oar
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
starved
and
branded
with
a
tattoo
of
demons
mask
on
one
cheek
His
face
has
been
so
bruised
and
swollen
that
he
is
almost
unrecognizable
Although
Jorah
has
treated
Tyrion
very
brutally
Tyrion
takes
no
pleasure
from
Jorahs
miseries
The
slavers
who
capture
Jorah
and
Tyrion
have
no
idea
who
Jorah
is
He
is
introduced
by
the
auctioneer
simply
as
big
and
strong
man
He
is
nearly
bought
by
Zahrina
for
the
fighting
pits
but
Tyrion
intervenes
and
persuades
the
overseer
of
Yezzans
slaves
to
buy
Jorah
too
claiming
that
he
takes
part
in
the
show
that
Tyrion
and
his
other
companion
play
for
entertainment
Jorah
does
not
try
to
escape
or
resist
his
captors
he
simply
ignores
their
commands
with
muttered
curses
so
he
is
locked
in
a
cage
and
beaten
severely
every
evening
to
the
point
that
he
hardly
looks
human
He
is
kept
naked
except
for
a
breechclout
a
filthy
bit
of
yellow
rag
He
never
gets
to
see
Daenerys
let
alone
speak
with
her
and
she
has
no
idea
he
is
nearby
Following
Daeneryss
departure
from
Meereen
Tyrion
and
Jorah
escape
from
Yezzan
to
the
camp
of
the
Second
Sons
who
betrayed
Daenerys
and
joined
the
Yunkai
Brown
Ben
Plumm
the
company
leader
is
astonished
to
see
Jorah
He
accepts
them
to
the
company
During
the
battle
between
Yunkai
and
the
defenders
of
Meereen
Jorah
tries
to
persuade
the
Second
Sons
to
switch
sides
He
promises
that
Find
her
hostages
Daario
Hero
and
Jhogo
and
free
them
And
I
will
swear
on
the
honor
of
my
house
and
home
that
this
was
Brown
Bens
plan
from
the
beginning
One
of
the
sellswords
says
that
it
is
for
Ben
Plumm
to
say
Shortly
afterwards
a
messenger
arrives
to
deliver
new
orders
Suddenly
herecognizes
Tyrion
as
an
escaped
slave
of
Yezzan
and
orders
surrender
him
Jorah
responds
by
killing
the
messenger
Jeor
Mormont
in
his
last
breath
told
Sam
Tarly
Tell
my
sonJorah
Tell
him
take
the
black
My
wish
Dying
wish
Tell
Jorah
Forgive
him
My
son
Please
So
far
in
the
novels
Jorah
has
not
been
informed
about
his
fathers
death
and
his
last
wish
According
to
the
TV
series
official

for

at

sets

for
Westeros
greensailed

presumably
from

Redwyne
Fleet
can
be
seen
amongst
her
assembled
armada
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Redwyne
fleet
is
a
fleet
in
the
service
of
House
Redwyne
of
the
Arbor
It
is
one
of
the
three
most
powerful
fleets
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
alongside
the
Royal
Fleet
and
the
Iron
Fleet
It
consists
of
two
hundred
warships
one
thousand
merchant
carracks
wine
cogs
trading
galleys
and
whalers
According
to
Jaime
it
is
the
largest
fleet
in
Westeros
The
Season
Bluray
special
features
display
the
Redwyne
sigil
under
a
list
of
Renly
Baratheons
supporters
but
in
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
House
Redwyne
doesnt
declare
for
Renly
They
wanted
to
but
during
the
early
stages
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
holds
the
twin
sons
of
Lord
Paxter
hostage
at
the
royal
court
After
Renly
dies
they
join
their
Tyrell
liege
lords
in
aiding
the
Lannister
army
in
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
The
practical
result
was
that
the
Redwyne
Fleet
sat
at
anchor
for
much
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
It
only
became
available
to
the
Lannisters
after
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
but
by
that
point
Stanniss
own
navy
was
destroyed
and
Robb
Starks
threat
was
from
land
not
from
the
sea
The
addition
of
the
Redwyne
Fleet
is
a
vital
necessity
to
the
Lannisters
after
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
during
which
most
of
the
original
Royal
Fleet
was
functionally
destroyed
The
Lannisters
consider
Stannis
to
be
a
bigger
threat
than
the
ironborn
so
they
begin
to
move
the
Redwyne
Fleet
east
to
blockade
Stanniss
remaining
forces
at
Storms
End
and
Dragonstone
It
takes
some
months
to
move
the
fleet
however
and
they
are
in
no
dire
hurry
because
Stannis
is
in
no
position
to
attack
Cersei
worries
however
that
this
makes
them
even
more
reliant
upon
the
Tyrells
and
their
vassals
from
the
Reach
This
eventually
leads
her
to
order
a
new
Royal
Fleet
paid
for
entirely
on
credit
as
the
Crown
is
deeply
in
debt
On
the
fourth
novel
Euron
Greyjoy
takes
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
Redwyne
fleet
is
away
from
the
Reach
and
launches
a
military
campaign
against
the
Reach
Once
Margaery
and
Loras
are
informed
that
the
ironborn
have
conquered
the
Shield
Islands
they
urge
Cersei
to
send
the
Redwyne
fleet
back
to
the
Reach
Cersei
who
secretly
gloats
over
the
Tyrells
distress
refuses
claiming
that
Storms
End
and
Dragonstone
are
much
more
important
thanShield
Islands
Loras
volunteers
to
conquer
Dragonstone
and
succeeds
though
the
victory
is
too
costly
Then
Cersei
allows
the
Redwyne
fleet
to
return
but
in
the
meantime
the
ironborn
have
conquered
the
Arbor
and
its
neighboring
islands
using
them
as
bases
prey
on
shipping
bound
for
Oldtown
Euron
and
his
subordinates
are
aware
that
the
Redwyne
fleet
is
on
its
way
to
fight
them
and
that
Lord
Leyton
Hightower
has
sent
against
them
a
second
fleet
but
they
seem
unconcerned

one
of

nine

on
the
shores
of

Sea
south

The
Stormlands
are
traditionally
ruled
from
the
castle

by
House
Baratheon
They
are
sonamed
for
the
savage
and
frequent
storms
from

batter

coast
It
was
originally
a
sovereign
nation
known
as
the
Storm

until
Aegon

Conqueror
united
Westeros
under
his
rule
When
Aegon

Geography
The
Stormlands
are
located
on
the
east
coast
of
Westeros
relatively
near
the
Free
Cities
in
Essos
across
the
Narrow
Sea
They
are
largely
separated
from
Dorne
to
the
south
by
an
inlet
of
the
Narrow
Sea
known
as
the
Sea
of
Dorne
In
the
north
Blackwater
Bay
separates
the
Stormlands
from
the
bulk
of
the
Crownlands
though
the
Crownlands
actually
extend
south
of
the
bay
in
a
small
strip
that
includes
the
northern
parts
of
the
Kingswood
as
well
as
the
peninsula
of
Masseys
Hook
To
the
west
the
Stormlands
share
a
long
border
with
the
Reach
which
extends
all
the
way
from
south
of
Highgarden
to
almost
reach
the
capital
city
of
Kings
Landing
in
the
north
The
vast
watershed
of
the
Mander
River
which
dominates
the
Reach
as
it
flows
west
does
not
extend
into
the
Stormlands
indeed
the
watershed
of
the
Mander
is
essentially
what
marks
the
border
between
the
Reach
and
the
Stormlands
The
main
portion
of
the
Stormlands
is
composed
of
two
peninsulas
one
in
the
north
and
one
in
the
south
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
the
coast
by
the
indentation
of
Shipbreakers
Bay
The
castle
seat
of
Storms
End
is
located
in
Shipbreakers
Bay
on
the
northern
side
The
northern
peninsula
terminates
in
Masseys
Hook
which
is
part
of
the
Crownlands
while
the
end
of
the
southern
peninsula
is
known
as
Cape
Wrath
because
it
is
the
target
of
the
worst
storms
coming
off
of
the
Narrow
Sea
To
the
southwest
the
long
chain
of
the
Red
Mountains
form
a
barrier
between
Dorne
and
the
rest
of
the
continent
particularly
the
regions
it
immediately
borders
the
Reach
to
the
west
and
northwest
and
the
Stormlands
to
the
northeast
A
large
salient
of
the
Stormlands
extend
southwest
of
the
main
coastal
area
which
includes
the
northern
portions
of
the
Red
Mountains
Called
the
Dornish
Marches
this
mountainous
region
is
home
to
marcherlords
who
rely
on
the
rough
terrain
to
defend
the
Stormlands
against
incursions
from
Dorne
or
the
Reach
The
extreme
northern
end
of
the
Red
Mountains
past
the
Dornish
Marches
extend
from
southwest
to
northeast
across
the
base
of
Cape
Wrath
terminating
around
the
inlet
of
Shipbreakers
Bay
This
makes
the
separation
between
the
northern
and
southern
peninsulas
of
the
Stormands
even
more
distinct
and
separates
the
Rainwood
in
Cape
Wrath
from
the
Kingswood
in
the
north
Several
large
offshore
islands
are
located
off
the
coast
which
are
considered
part
of
the
Stormlands
and
sworn
to
Storms
End
The
largest
by
far
is
the
island
of
Tarth
located
off
the
coast
of
the
northern
half
of
the
Stormlands
A
mountainous
island
famed
for
its
rugged
beauty
the
Straits
of
Tarth
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
are
much
more
calm
than
the
dangerous
and
aptly
named
Shipbreakers
Bay
to
the
south
Tarth
provides
enough
of
a
breaker
for
storms
that
the
northern
peninsula
of
the
Stormlands
on
the
mainland
has
somewhat
calmer
weather
than
Cape
Wrath
to
the
south
Moreover
unlike
the
Rainwood
which
covers
all
of
the
Cape
Wrath
peninsula
the
Kingswood
does
not
extend
over
the
eastern
coastal
plain
of
the
northern
peninsula
Thus
the
region
around
Storms
End
itself
is
composed
of
fertile
coastal
plains
The
Stormlands
have
a
warm
wet
climate
due
to
all
of
the
storms
that
batter
it
from
the
Narrow
Sea
to
the
east
The
high
mountains
of
the
Dornish
Marches
to
the
southwest
however
are
said
to
have
a
very
cold
alpine
climate
The
Stormlands
are
one
of
the
most
heavily
forested
regions
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Two
of
the
three
large
forests
of
the
realm
are
located
there
the
Kingswood
in
the
north
straddling
the
border
with
the
Crownlands
and
the
Rainwood
in
the
southern
half
of
the
Stormlands
The
third
large
forest
the
Wolfswood
is
located
in
the
North
but
due
to
the
large
size
of
the
North
it
does
not
dominate
the
entire
region
In
contrast
due
to
its
moderate
size
the
Kingswood
and
Rainwood
combined
cover
most
of
the
Stormlands
Combined
with
the
wet
weather
coming
from
the
Narrow
Sea
the
climate
of
the
Stormlands
is
predominantly
temperate
rainforest
The
Kingsroad
begins
at
Storms
End
in
the
south
linking
travel
to
Kings
Landing
just
north
of
the
Stormlands
and
ultimately
leading
all
the
way
north
through
the
Riverlands
to
Winterfell
and
the
Wall
Travel
between
the
Stormlands
and
Dorne
is
only
possible
through
two
dangerous
passes
through
the
Red
Mountains
the
Princes
Pass
and
the
Boneway
There
are
no
major
roads
running
directly
between
the
Stormlands
and
the
Reach
however
travelers
from
the
Stormlands
can
use
the
nearby
Roseroad
between
Kings
Landing
and
Highgarden
in
the
Reach
A
traveler
from
Storms
End
would
only
have
to
travel
along
the
Kingsroad
to
slightly
north
of
the
border
into
the
Crownlands
where
the
Roseroad
meets
with
the
Kingsroad
just
south

the

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Storm
Kingdom
is
said
to
have
contested
frequently
with
the
Riverlands
to
the
north
the
Reach
to
the
southwest
and
Dorne
to
the
south
over
territory
The
Stormlands
are
usually
damp
and
wet
and
also
contain
many
forests
including
the
Kingswood
in
the
north
and
Rainwood
in
the
south
The
Stormlands
consist
of
a
main
area
along
the
coast
and
a
long
salient
to
the
southwest
stretching
along
the
Red
Mountains
This
salient
is
known
as
the
Dornish
Marches
and
serves
as
an
effective
buffer
zone
between
the
old
enemies
of
the
Reach
and
Dorne
Some
years
prior
to
the
Targaryen
Conquest
the
Stormlands
conquered
the
area
which
would
later
be
known
as
the
Riverlands
which
was
not
politically
unified
at
the
time
The
Stormlands
continued
to
rule
the
Riverlands
for
three
centuries
until
roughly
three
generations
before
the
Targaryen
Conquest
when
the
Riverlands
were
in
turn
conquered
by
the
Iron
Islands
driving
the
Storm
Kings
back
to
the
Stormlands
The
Stormlands
have
been
known
to
become
involved
in
some
of
the
wars
of
the
Free
Cities
which
also
border
the
Narrow
Sea
though
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
as
much
cultural
contact
with
them
as
Dorne
does
During
the
Bleeding
Years
following
the
downfall
of
Valyria
the
old
Storm
Kings
joined
the
alliance
of
Tyrosh
Pentos
Braavos
Lys
and
Myr
against
Volantis
when
Volantis
attempted
to
conquer
all
of
the
other
Free
Cities
George
RR
Martin
has
on
occasion
remarked
that
the
Stormlands
are
somewhat
comparable
to
medieval
Germany
in
that
like
Germany
they
are
very
heavily
forested
Two
of
the
three
remaining
large
forests
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
located
in
the
Stormlands
the
third
is
the
Wolfswood
located
in
the
North
However
this
also
means
that
the
Stormlands
are
not
as
agriculturally
developed
as
other
parts
of
Westeros
particularly
the
fertile
fields
of
the
Reach
As
a
result
the
Stormlands
cannot
raise
armies
as
large
as
the
Reach
can
Another
similarity
is
that
the
Reach
is
analogous
to
France
and
France
and
Germany
share
a
long
and
illdefined
border
just
as
the
Reach
and
the
Stormlands
didnt
have
a
welldefined
border
before
the
Targaryen
Conquest
just
a
vague
borderzone
along
the
Dornish
Marches
and
the
upper
valleys
of
the
Mander
River

its
tributaries

I
could
see
from
the
outline
that
if
I
was
going
to
play
Jorah
I
would
be
in
it
for
the
long
haul
His
journey
is
slow
burn
through
the
course
of
many
seasons
Such
roles
afford
the
opportunity
to
develop
character
more
roundly
more
like
real
life
I
guess
where
personality
reveals
itself
over
time
It
felt
like
a
luxury
not
to
have
to
show
too
much
too
quickly

At

that

Glovers
have
retaken
Deepwood
Motte
and
executed
the
ironborn
garrison
stationed
there
With
the
loss
of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses
the
Unsullied
to
lay
siege
to
Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara
realises
that
Euron
has
come
On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in

As
Euron

his
plank
onto
the

Sand
midbattle
to
protect
her
mother
who
is
still
below

burning
fleet
she
has
a
moment

holds
Yara
hostage
After
he
kills

Euron
locks
eyes
with
Yara
and
they
begin
duelling
Despite
her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral

occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

garrison
stationed
there
With
the
loss
of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon

Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have

immediately
attack
Kings
Landing

to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara

Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion

Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara

reminisce
about

Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara

Euron
locks
eyes
with
Yara
and
they
begin
duelling
Despite
her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

Biography
Background
Maekar
was
the
fourth
son
and
fifth
child
of
King
Daeron
II
Targaryen
and
Queen
Myriah
Martell
His
siblings
were
Baelor
Aerys
I
Aelinor
and
Rhaegel
He
wed
Dyanna
of
House
Dayne
with
whom
he
had
three
sons
Aerion
who
ultimately
killed
himself
by
drinking
wildfire
Aemon
who
would
become
a
Maester
at
Castle
Black
and
a
member
of
the
Nights
Watch
and
Aegon
V
Targaryen
who
would
succeed
him
to
the
Iron
Throne
Although
he
was
the
fourth
son
a
rather
grim
chain
of
events
ultimately
led
to
his
ascension
to
the
Iron
Throne
First
he
accidentally
killed
his
oldest
brother
Baelor
in
the
Trial
by
Seven
of
Duncan
the
Tall
which
was
ironically
provoked
by
his
eldest
son
Aerion
This
led
to
the
ascension
of
the
second
son
Aerys
I
who
died
without
issue
The
third
son
Rhaegel
either
predeceased
both
Aerys
and
Maekar
or
was
skipped
over
because
he
had
succumbed
to
the
Targaryen
madness
that
has
afflicted
many
members
of
House
Targaryen
due
to
multiple
generations
of
compound
inbreeding
hence
the
throne
passed
to
Maekar
instead

The
Riverlands
is
one
of
the
constituent
regions
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
They
have
been
a
frequent
battleground
in
the
civil
wars
that
have
afflicted
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
also
in
the
wars
that
took
place
between
the
old
nations
of
the
continent
before
the
Targaryen
Conquest
During
the
time
of
the
First
Men
the
Riverlands
were
an
independent
kingdom
known
as
the
Kingdom
of
the
Rivers
and
the
Hills
Located
roughly
in
the
center
of
the
continent
and
with
few
geographical
boundaries
such
as
mountains
for
centuries
it
has
been
a
borderland
between
surrounding
strong
kingdoms
The
Riverlands
were
ruled
by
the
ironborn
at
the
time
of
the
Targaryen
Conquest
and
Aegon
the
Conquerors
assault
was
assisted
by
a
popular
uprising
led
by
House
Tully
For
this
reason
the
Riverlands
didnt
have
a
king
at
the
time
of
the
invasion
and
the
Riverlands
are
not
technically
counted
as
one
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
instead
essentially
making
up
the
eighth
kingdom
However
for
administrative
purposes
the
Riverlands
and
their
rulers
are
equal
to
any
other
region
of
the
realm
The
Riverlands
are
currently
in
anarchy
after
the
assassinations
at
the
Twins
though
a
Lannister
host
has
been
deployed
to
attempt
to
keep
the
peace
Bastards
born
in
the
Riverlands
are
given
the
surname
Rivers
During
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
the
riverlords
hailed
Robb
Stark
who
was
the
grandson
of
Hoster
Tully
through
his
daughter
Catelyn
as
their
King
in
the
North
thus
becoming
part
of
the
resurgent
Kingdom
of
the
North
However
Robb
Edmure
Tully
and
their
bannermen
were
betrayed
at
the
Red
Wedding
by
two
of
their
own
bannermen
Roose
Bolton
and
Walder
Frey
House
Frey
was
then
elevated
to
rule
of
the
Riverlands
However
the
Freys
were
actively
opposed
by
many
of
the
riverlords
including
Ser
Brynden
Tully
who
managed
to
retake
Riverrun
though
eventually
lost
it
when
a
Lannister
host
arrived
to
assist
the
Freys
in
their
siege
of
Riverrun
Walder
Frey
and
the
rest
of
the
Frey
men
were
eventually
assassinated
by
Arya
Stark
in
retribution
for
their
treachery
leaving
the
Riverlands
in
disarray
and
their
political
status
ambiguous
Contentsshow
Geography
The
Riverlands
are
dominated
by
the
watershed
of
the
Trident
River
socalled
because
of
its
three
major
tributaries
the
Green
Fork
the
Blue
Fork
and
the
Red
Fork
which
converge
at
Ruby
Ford
in
the
east
The
Green
Fork
is
the
northernmost
running
northtosouth
almost
up
to
the
Neck
near
the
entrance
to
the
Starkheld
North
The
Green
Fork
is
only
traversable
via
the
castlebridge
complex
known
as
The
Twins
ruled
by
House
Frey
Thus
large
armies
attempting
to
move
into
or
out
of
the
North
are
faced
with
only
two
predictable
choices
travel
along
the
Kingsroad
as
it
crosses
the
Ruby
Ford
to
the
east
or
cross
the
Green
Fork
at
the
Twins
to
the
west
which
requires
paying
an
often
steep
toll
to
House
Frey
Map
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
marking
the
location
of
the
Riverlands
in
red
The
Blue
Fork
is
south
of
the
Green
Fork
and
terminates
near
Seagard
The
Red
Fork
is
the
southernmost
and
winds
its
way
through
the
heart
of
the
Riverlands
between
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Gods
Eye
lake
further
south
After
it
passes
Riverrun
castle
the
capital
of
the
Riverlands
the
Red
Fork
passes
further
to
the
south
and
west
until
it
reaches
the
borders
of
the
Westerlands
held
by
House
Lannister
On
the
whole
the
Riverlands
possess
few
natural
defenses
or
borders
They
are
bordered
to
the
west
and
the
east
by
mountains
but
these
are
possessed
by
the
Westerlandsand
the
Vale
of
Arryn
respectively
Rather
these
are
natural
defenses
that
the
Westerlands
and
Vale
possess
against
the
Riverlands
The
extensive
swamps
and
narrow
isthmus
of
The
Neck
also
form
an
effective
natural
barrier
but
these
are
part
of
the
North
under
the
Starks
again
more
of
a
defense
against
invasion
from
the
Riverlands
than
the
other
way
around
The
southern
border
of
the
Riverlands
is
more
or
less
formed
by
the
upper
reaches
of
the
Blackwater
River
but
this
is
not
a
particular
impediment
to
travel
between
the
Riverlands
and
the
Reach
to
the
south
To
the
southeast
the
Riverlands
border
the
Crownlands
but
this
is
purely
administrative
and
not
a
geographical
border
Further
the
northwest
coast
of
the
Riverlands
sits
on
Ironmans
Bay
and
is
thus
open
to
raiding
from
the
Iron
Islands
All
told
the
Riverlands
border
five
other
regions
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
six
if
the
water
border
with
the
Iron
Islands
is
counted
and
which
due
to
frequent
ironborn
coastal
raids
it
usually
is
Thus
the
Riverlands
match
the
Reach
in
bordering
the
largest
number
of
other
regions
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
However
the
Reach
has
some
natural
defenses
such
as
the
Red
Mountains
along
its
eastern
border
and
a
large
coastline
which
while
open
to
ironborn
raiding
isnt
as
open
to
attack
as
the
long
land
borders
of
the
Riverlands
which
are
not
very
defensible
The
Reach
is
located
in
the
southwest
corner
of
Westeros
while
the
Riverlands
are
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
powerful
neighbors
Further
the
Riverlands
are
still
fairly
close
to
the
Stormlands
to
the
point
that
the
Stormlands
conquered
and
ruled
the
Riverlands
for
years
before
the
Targaryen
Conquest
before
being
pushed
out
by
the
Iron
Islands
The
Riverlands
have
a
true
temperate
climate
with
warm
summers
and
moderately
cold
winters
which
increase
in
severity
north
of
the
Neck
Rainfall
is
moderate
and
adequate
providing
for
the
fertility
of
the
region

books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Riverlands
is
relatively
small
in
size
but
high
in
population
It
is
fertile
due
to
the
numerous
rivers
that
run
across
its
expanse
most
notably
the
massive
River
Trident
and
its
numerous
tributaries
The
people
of
the
Riverlands
are
known
as
rivermen
They
are
a
mixture
of
hardy
warriors
peaceful
fisherfolk
and
devout
smallfolk
The
Riverlands
possess
a
number
of
middlingtolarge
towns
such
as
Maidenpool
Saltpans
Fairmarket
and
Stoney
Sept
The
borders
of
the
Riverlands
are
held
to
be
the
marshes
of
the
Neck
in
the
far
north
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
to
the
northeast
the
Blackwater
Rush
to
the
south
and
the
hills
of
the
Westerlands
to
the
west
The
Riverlands
used
to
be
a
kingdom
in
its
own
right
but
centuries
before
the
Targaryen
invasion
they
were
overrun
and
conquered
by
the
armies
of
the
Storm
King
The
Storm
King
couldnt
hold
such
a
large
territory
especially
when
the
ironborn
invaded
in
force
from
the
west
and
was
forced
to
cede
the
Riverlands
to
King
Hoare
of
the
Iron
Islands
The
ironborn
set
about
erecting
a
massive
fortress
on
the
lake
known
as
the
Gods
Eye
completing
it
on
the
very
day
that
Aegon
the
Conqueror
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
Westeros
Aegons
dragons
burned
out
the
castle
Harrenhal
killing
King
Harren
the
Black
Lord
Edmyn
Tully
of
Riverrun
led
a
popular
rebellion
of
the
river
lords
against
the
ironborn
helping
Aegon
drive
them
out
For
this
act
Aegon
made
House
Tully
the
rulers
of
the
Riverlands
in
his
name

Summary
In
Kings
Landing
Euron
parades
the
captives
Yara
Ellaria
and
Tyene
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
reveling
in
his
victory
all
the
way
to
the
Red
Keep
The
crowd
pelt
Yara
Ellaria
and
Tyene
with
rotting
fruit
Impressed
with
his
gift
Cersei
agrees
to
an
alliance
with
the
Lord
Reaper
and
praises
him
as
a
true
friend
to
the
Crown
Ellaria
spits
at
Cerseis
feet
while
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
is
present
among
the
Queensguard
When
Euron
demands
his
reward
Cersei
responds
that
he
will
get
it
once
the
war
is
over
Cersei
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
and
her
brother
Jaime
Lannister
as
commander
of
her
armies
Despite
the
fanfare
Jaime
is
privately
hostile
towards
Euron
and
tells
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke
that
his
head
belongs
on
a
spike
Euron
tells
Jaime
that
he
desires
Cersei
and
asks
for
tips
about
her
sexual
tastes
much
to
Jaimes
silent
fury
Euron
brings
Ellaria
and
Tyene
as
a
gift
to
Cersei
Later
Cersei
confronts
Ellaria
and
Tyene
in
their
cell
where
both
are
gagged
and
chained
to
opposite
walls
Accompanied
by
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
and
Qyburn
Cersei
remembers
Oberyn
Martells
showdown
with
Ser
Gregor
during
Tyrions
second
trial
by
combat
sadistically
recalling
the
Red
Vipers
savage
death
to
Ellaria
and
how
Ellaria
screamed
at
the
sight
of
it
She
later
provokes
Ellarias
sorrow
by
recalling
Oberyns
fearsome
skill
with
a
spear
and
how
that
eventually
didnt
stop
Gregor
from
killing
him
as
well
as
inferring
that
Oberyn
brought
his
death
on
himself
by
taunting
Gregor
instead
of
just
leaving
him
to
die
She
then
remembers
raising
Myrcella
and
the
fact
that
Ellaria
murdered
her
Ellaria
and
Tyene
met
their
fate
Cersei
goes
on
to
praise
Tyenes
beauty
to
Ellaria
and
suggesting
that
she
is
Ellarias
favorite
She
contemplates
how
she
will
execute
Ellaria
or
Tyene
cruelly
suggesting
Ser
Gregor
kill
them
the
way
he
killed
Oberyn
However
opining
that
it
would
be
too
fast
a
death
she
kisses
Tyene
with
the
Long
Farewell
citing
poetic
justice
for
Myrcellas
murder
and
torments
Ellaria
by
having
Qyburn
confirm
the
uncertainty
of
when
the
girl
will
die
but
also
the
inevitability
of
it
as
the
Long
Farewell
varies
on
how
long
it
takes
to
kill
depending
on
the
strength
of
its
victims
constitution
Cersei
tells
Ellaria
that
she
will
be
left
alive
to
witness
the
event
as
well
as
to
watch
her
daughters
beautiful
face
crumble
into
bone
and
dust
and
that
she
will
be
made
to
contemplate
the
things
she
has
done
even
to
the
point
of
being
forcefed
if
she
tries
to
starve
herself
to
death
Before
leaving
Cersei
orders
that
torches
be
routinely
replaced
so
that
Ellaria
doesnt
miss
a
moment
of
Tyenes
demise
as
Ellaria
frantically
struggles
against
her
chains
in
a
futile
effort
to
reach
her
daughter
Later
that
evening
Jaime
is
drinking
wine
for
supper
when
Cersei
arrives
and
kisses
him
He
initially
rebuffs
her
advances
but
ultimately
consents
to
sex
The
next
morning
following
an
incestuous
night
with
Jaime
Cersei
answers
the
door
for
a
servant
who
announces
that
a
visitor
from
Braavos
has
arrived
Cersei
acknowledges
the
message
and
requests
fresh
sheets
Cersei
meets
with
Tycho
Nestoris
a
representative
from
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
who
offers
his
condolences
for
the
loss
of
her
son
Tommen
Baratheon
Tycho
thanks
Cersei
for
eradicating
the
Faith
Militant
which
he
describes
as
superstition
Cersei
realizes
that
the
Iron
Bank
wants
to
bet
on
the
strongest
faction
Cersei
tells
Tycho
that
Lord
Euron
controls
the
sea
and
is
an
ally
for
the
time
being
Cersei
convinces
Nestoris
to
side
with
the
Lannisters
by
denouncing
Daenerys
as
a
revolutionary
rather
than
a
monarch
She
promises
that
the
Lannisters
will
pay
their
debts
unlike
the
Dothraki
and
former
slaves
Cerseivows
to
pay
the
Crowns
debts
in
full
within
a
fortnight
and
invites
Nestoris
to
stay
in
Kings
Landing
Nestoris
is
pleased
and
describes
Cersei
as
her
fathers
daughter
At
Winterfell
Sansa
and
Bran
reunite
in
Winterfell
At
Winterfell
Sansa
and
Petyr
Baelish
learn
from
Maester
Wolkan
that
they
have
about
bushels
of
wheat
Sansa
realizes
that
they
dont
have
enough
food
for
the
coming
winter
She
advocates
building
granaries
to
stockpile
for
a
famine
Sansa
also
orders
Yohn
Royce
to
see
that
the
armor
made
for
their
armies
is
outfitted
with
leather
to
keep
warm
While
walking
Baelish
and
Sansa
talk
about
the
threat
of
Cersei
Petyr
urges
her
to
fight
every
battle
and
to
look
for
threats
in
every
corner
They
are
then
interupted
by
a
guard
who
tells
Lady
Stark
that
she
has
received
a
visitor
who
turns
out
to
be
her
younger
brother
Bran
Stark
accompanied
by
Meera
Reed
Following
a
tearful
reunion
the
two
siblings
retreat
to
the
Godswood
where
Sansa
tells
Bran
how
she
wishes
Jon
were
there
with
them
at
Winterfell
Bran
agrees
noting
that
he
needs
to
speak
to
Jon
When
Sansa
points
out
that
Bran
is
the
rightful
Lord
of
Winterfell
since
he
is
the
last
remaining
trueborn
son
of
Ned
Stark
he
refuses
the
position
stating
that
he
is
the
ThreeEyed
Raven
and
thus
cant
be
any
sort
of
Lord
Sansa
begs
for
Bran
to
explain
what
that
means
and
Bran
then
demonstrates
his
newlyacquired
power
to
a
skeptical
Sansa
by
recalling
details
from
the
night
of
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
Startled
Sansa
walks
away
in
shock
and
tears
In
Oldtown
At
the
Citadel
Archmaester
Ebrose
examines
Jorah
Mormonts
wounds
and
surmises
that
the
infection
is
no
longer
active
Ebrose
realizes
that
somebody
treated
Jorah
but
Mormont
claims
that
rest
and
the
climate
healed
him
Ebrose
lets
Jorah
go
but
orders
a
private
audience
with
Samwell
Tarly
later
that
evening
Jorah
tells
Sam
that
he
is
returning
to
Daenerys
because
she
gave
him
hope
and
a
sense
of
purpose
Jorah
thanks
Sam
for
treating
him
and
Sam
says
its
the
least
he
could
do
given
everything
that
Jeor
Mormont
did
for
him
Sam
confesses
to
Ebrose
In
private
Ebrose
chastises
Sam
for
embarking
on
an
illegal
healing
procedure
due
to
the
high
risk
of
infection
Nevertheless
he
praises
Sam
for
his
success
noting
that
it
was
an
extraordinarily
difficult
operation
and
asks
for
the
secret
of
his
success
Sam
replies
that
he
simply
read
the
books
and
followed
the
instructions
Ebrose
congratulates
Sam
by
telling
him
to
make
fresh
copies
of
several
old
manuscripts
and
scrolls
so
their
knowledge
can
be
preserved
explaining
that
Sams
reward
is
not
being
expelled
from
the
Citadel
On
Dragonstone
Jon
and
Davos
arrive
at
Dragonstone
and
are
immediately
greeted
by
Tyrion
and
Missandei
Upon
meeting
Tyrion
address
Jon
as
the
bastard
of
Winterfell
while
Jon
addresses
him
as
the
dwarf
of
Casterly
Rock
the
two
share
a
friendly
grin
Jon
observes
that
Tyrion
has
picked
up
some
scars
Jon
also
introduces
Davos
while
Tyrion
introduces
Missandei
who
requests
that
they
surrender
their
weapons
Jon
and
his
entourage
hand
over
their
weapons
to
Daeneryss
Dothraki
guards
On
the
walk
to
the
castle
Missandei
walks
with
Davos
and
tells
him
that
she
comes
from
the
island
of
Naath
Davos
remarks
that
it
was
a
paradise
full
of
palm
trees
Jon
and
Tyrion
talk
about
Sansa
Starks
marriage
to
Tyrion
Tyrion
assures
Jon
that
it
was
a
sham
and
was
never
consummated
and
remarks
that
she
is
a
lot
smarter
than
she
lets
on
to
which
Jon
agrees
While
Jon
is
aware
about
the
fate
of
the
previous
Starks
who
had
met
with
the
Mad
King
Jon
insists
that
he
is
not
a
Stark
Jon
and
Davos
are
startled
at
the
sight
of
Drogon
and
Viserion
flying
low
over
the
causeway
and
dive
to
the
ground
while
an
amused
Missandei
and
Tyrion
retain
their
composure
Offering
Jon
a
hand
up
Tyrion
says
he
wishes
he
could
tell
Jon
hell
get
used
to
the
dragons
but
no
one
is
quite
used
to
them
except
their
mother
who
is
waiting
for
Jon
within
Davos
and
Jon
arrive
and
see
Danys
dragons
for
the
first
time
On
the
cliffs
overlooking
the
beach
Varys
confronts
Melisandre
about
her
reluctance
to
see
the
King
in
the
North
Melisandre
responds
to
his
prodding
that
she
parted
on
bad
terms
with
Jon
and
Davos
Seaworth
because
of
terrible
mistakes
she
made
She
says
that
now
that
she
has
brought
ice
and
fire
together
she
will
end
her
previous
habit
of
whispering
in
the
ears
of
kings
and
indicates
her
intention
to
travel
to
Volantis
When
Varys
suggests
that
she
should
not
return
to
Westeros
Melisandre
replies
that
she
will
return
one
last
time
as
she
is
destined
to
die
in
Westeros
just
like
Varys
In
the
throne
room
Missandei
introduces

At

awkward
prompting
a
slightly
amused
Davos
introduces
Jon
simply
as
King
in
the
North
Daenerys
thanks
Jon
for
travelling
so
far
but
refers
to
him
as
a
Lord
Davos
begs
to
differ
but
Daenerys
responds
that
there
has
been
no
King
in
the
North
ever
since
Torrhen
Stark
bent
the
knee
to
Aegon
the
Conqueror
and
adds
that
an
oath
lasts
for
perpetuity
Dany
then
reiterates
her
demand
for
Jon
to
bend
the
knee
but
he
refuses
When
Dany
accuses
him
of
breaking

with
House
Targaryen
Jon
reminds
her
that

Daenerys
apologizes
for

fathers
actions
and
stresses
that

for
the
crimes
of
their
parents
She
then
urges
Jon
to
renew
the
historic
allegiance
between
their
two
great
houses
Jon
expresses
agreement
with
Daenerys
view
that

for
the
crimes
of
their

the
fighting
between
the
Great
Houses
to
children
squabbling
over
a
game
Jon
points
out
that
the
army
of
the
dead
is
their
true
enemy
Daenerys
is
sceptical
but
Tyrion
vouches
for
Jon
Jon
says
that
they
need
to
make
cause
to
fight
against
the
army
of
the
dead
Daenerys
asks
if
Jon
knew
if
his
father
knew
that
his
best
friend
had
sent
assassins
to
kill
her
as
a
baby
not
knowing
that
Lord
Eddard
Stark
had
opposed
King
Robert
Baratheons
assassination
plot
Dany
recounts
that
she
was
targeted
by
assassins
enslaved
raped
and
defiled
but
that
her
faith
in
herself
rather
the
gods
kept
her
going
Daenerys
talks
about
the
miracle
of
her
dragons
hatching
and
the
Dothraki
crossing
the
Narrow
Sea
When
Daenerys
reiterates
that
she
is
destined
to
rule
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Jon
retorts
that
she
will
be
ruling
over
a
graveyard
and
points
out
that
the
Night
King
is
their
true
enemy
Tyrion
says
they
cannot
split
their
forces
Davos
then
speaks
up
for
his
liege
lord
and
tells
Dany
that
Jon
won
the
support
of
the
Wildlings
and
fought
the
White
Walkers
but
Jon
cuts
him
off
when
he
tries
to
mention
the
true
outcome
of
the
Mutiny
at
Castle
Black
Davos
says
that
it
doesnt
matter
who
bends
the
knee
but
Tyrion
doesnt
see
the
point
of
Jons
refusal
to
submit
When
Jon
disputes
Daenerys
claims
to
Queenship
Dany
responds
that
he
is
in
open
rebellion
since
he
has
declared
himself
King
in
the
North
Daenerys
then
receives
a
message
from
Varys
Dany
orders
Missandei
to
give
Jon
and
his
followers
food
and
lodging
then
ominously
gives
a
series
of
clipped
orders
in
Dothraki
to
Qhono
When
Jon
asks
if
he
is
a
prisoner
she
says
not
yet
Varys
tells
her
that
the
Targaryen
fleet
was
ambushed
by
Euron
Greyjoys
Iron
Fleet
in
the
Narrow
Seas
He
informs
her
that
Yara
Greyjoy
Ellaria
Sand
and
her
daughter
Tyene
Sand
were
captured
In
response
to
this
grim
news
Daenerys
allows
Jon
and
Davos
to
stay
until
they
can
reach
a
proper
agreement
Jon
examines
Dragonstone
Later
Jon
and
Tyrion
discuss
his
predicament
Jon
is
unhappy
that
he
is
a
prisoner
while
the
White
Walkers
and
the
Night
King
still
pose
a
threat
Tyrion
says
he
trusts
the
word
of
Jeor
Mormont
and
Jon
Jon
asks
Tyrion
how
he
can
convince
people
about
the
existence
of
things
which
they
dont
believe
exist
Jon
wants
to
help
his
people
and
is
frustrated
with
the
deadlock
Tyrion
encourages
Jon
not
to
give
up
When
Jon
remarks
that
he
is
a
fool
for
going
south
Tyrion
reassures
him
that
the
Mad
Kings
daughter
is
not
her
father
and
has
protected
people
from
monsters
telling
him
to
speak
with
her
servants
Tyrion
asks
if
there
is
something
he
can
do
to
help
Jon
After
learning
about
the
dragon
glass
beneath
Dragonstone
Tyrion
speaks
with
Dany
about
Jons
request
to
access
the
material
Dany
is
preoccupied
with
the
loss
of
two
allies
Tyrion
convinces
Dany
to
let
Jon
have
the
dragon
glass
in
order
to
court
his
allegiance
and
tells
her
to
give
him
something
so
that
they
can
focus
on
Casterly
Rock
Dany
listens
to
her
Hands
advice
but
seems
more
preoccupied
with
what
Davos
was
about
to
say
about
Jon
in
the
throne
room
Tyrion
dismisses
it
as
Northern
hyperbole
Jon
converses
with
Daenerys
While
Dany
is
watching
over
her
dragons
she
is
joined
by
Jon
Dany
tells
Jon
that
she
named
her
dragons
Rhaegal
and
Viserion
after
her
brothers
Rhaegar
and
Viserys
Targaryen
Jon
realizes
that
Tyrion
has
been
petitioning
her
Dany
tells
Jon
she
is
determined
to
remove
Cersei
She
allows
Jon
to
mine
the
dragon
glass
and
agrees
to
provide
men
and
equipment
Desperate
for
some
validation
he
asks
if
she
believes
in
the
Night
King
and
White
Walkers
she
tells
him
to
get
to
work
In
the
waters
of
the
Narrow
Sea
near
Dragonstone
Theon
Greyjoy
is
fished
aboard
by
one
of
the
few
surviving
ships
of
Yara
Greyjoys
fleet
When
the
Ironborn
question
him
on
what
happened
to
Yara
Theon
lies
and
mentions
that
he
tried
in
vain
to
save
her
leaving
them
unimpressed
One
of
the
men
replies
that
he
wouldnt
be
here
if
he
tried
to
save
her
In
the
Chamber
of
Painted
Table
Dany
confers
with
her
advisers
Tyrion
Varys
and
Missandei
Dany
proposes
going
out
with
her
dragons
to
hunt
Euron
Greyjoys
Iron
Fleet
but
Missandei
and
Tyrion
argue
against
it
they
have
no
idea
where
Euron
is
and
all
it
would
take
is
for
one
stray
arrow
to
kill
Daenerys
and
the
dragons
would
be
uncontrollable
Tyrion
thinks
that
the
Lannisters
will
put
up
a
fierce
fight
for
Casterly
Rock
Tyrion
tells
her
that
the
gates
and
walls
of
Casterly
Rock
are
impregnable
to
siege
However
his
father
Tywin
assigned
Tyrion
to
build
the
sewers
in
his
youth
Tyrion
tells
them
that
he
built
a
secret
tunnel
through
a
cove
to
bring
in
prostitutes
Tyrions
remarks
are
interspersed
with
scenes
of
the
Unsullied
trying
to
storm
the
fortress
At
Casterly
Rock
The
Unsullied
take
Casterly
Rock
In
the
Westerlands
Grey
Worm
and
the
Unsullied
lay
siege
to
the
Lannister
seat
of
Casterly
Rock
but
face
fierce
resistance
at
the
gates
and
walls
The
Unsullied
managed
to
sneak
in
through
Tyrions
secret
cove
tunnel
Following
fierce
fighting
Grey
Worm
managed
to
overwhelm
the
garrison
and
capture
the
castle
Grey
Worm
quickly
realizes
that
the
Lannisters
have
only
installed
a
skeletal
garrison
Overlooking
the
battlements
Grey
Worm
questions
a
wounded
Lannister
soldier
about
where
the
main
Lannister
forces
are
and
realizes
that
they
have
stumbled
into
a
trap
Eurons
Iron
Fleet
sneaks
up
on
the
Unsullied
fleet
from
behind
and
unleashes
projectiles
setting
many
Targaryen
ships
ablaze
At
Highgarden
The
Lannister
forces
attack
Highgarden
Meanwhile
in
the
Reach
farther
south
Jaime
Lannister
Randyll
Tarly
and
Bronn
lead
the
Lannister
and
rebel
forces
towards
Highgarden
Olenna
Tyrell
looks
out
from
a
balcony
and
sees
the
impending
army
approaching
the
castle
The
battle
is
swift
slaughtering
the
Tyrell
soldiers
in
Highgarden
Jaime
finds
Olenna
sitting
alone
in
her
study
He
confirms
that
the
battle
is
over
as
Olenna
admits
that
the
Tyrell
army
wasnt
known
for
their
prowess
She
informs
Jaime
that
Tyrion
and
Daenerys
planned
to
invade
Casterly
Rock
and
thought
the
main
Lannister
force
would
be
defending
it
Jaime
while
pouring
two
glasses
of
wine
reveals
it
was
a
setup
explaining
that
his
ancestral
home
is
now
practically
worthless
aside
from
childhood
sentiment
a
token
garrison
was
left
behind
and
the
Rocks
stores
were
emptied
before
they
fled
He
also
states
Eurons
Iron
Fleet
will
destroy
the
attacking
fleet
leaving
the
Unsullied
trapped
deep
in
Westeros
at
the
mercy
of
Lannister
forces
Meanwhile
the
main
Lannister
army
would
be
far
away
from
the
main
attack
a
strategic
move
Jaime
learnt
from
Robb
Starks
attack
at
the
Whispering
Wood
Olenna
wonders
why
Tywin
Lannister
didnt
just
take
Highgarden
when
Casterly
Rocks
mines
first
ran
out
of
gold
Knowing
her
end
is
near
she
remarks
that
she
may
ask
Tywin
himself
soon
enough
Olenna
has
her
final
words
with
Jaime
Olenna
asks
Jaime
how
he
intends
to
kill
her
speculating
he
will
kill
her
with
Widows
Wail
Joffrey
Baratheons
old
sword
Remarking
on
Joffreys
horrible
nature
Olenna
proudly
admits
that
she
enacted
measures
to
protect
her
family
at
all
costs
with
no
regrets
but
reflects
that
her
actions
pale
in
comparison
to
the
atrocities
performed
by
Cersei
She
tells
Jaime
that
Cersei
is
a
monster
a
matter
of
opinion
according
to
Jaime
While
some
may
dread
her
Jaime
insists
that
none
will
care
what
she
has
done
so
long
as
order
is
restored
Olenna
observes
that
Jaime
really
does
love
his
sister
and
calls
him
a
fool
claiming
that
she
will
be
the
end
of
him
and
that
by
the
time
he
realizes
what
a
disease
Cersei
is
it
will
be
far
too
late
for
him
Jaime
considers
this
a
moot
point
of
little
value
discussing
with
Olenna
although
she
points
out
that
as
an
experienced
person
about
to
die
she
is
the
perfect
person
to
discuss
his
life
with
Olenna
again
asks
Jaime
how
he
plans
to
kill
her
Jaime
tells
her
of
Cerseis
idea
of
having
her
whipped
and
beheaded
or
flayed
alive
and
hanged
but
he
talked
her
out
of
those
ideas
He
then
produces
a
small
vial
and
empties
its
contents
into
one
of
the
glasses
of
wine
giving
it
to
Olenna
who
then
drinks
it
after
Jaime
confirms
that
it
will
be
a
painless
death
Olenna
reflects
on
the
horrible
way
that
Joffrey
died
and
the
gruesome
details
that
the
poison
caused
she
admits
that
part
was
unintentional
on
her
part
as
she
had
never
seen
the
strangler
work
in
person
before
Shocked
into
silence
Jaime
stares
at
her
realizing
at
last
who
really
killed
his
eldest
son
and
let
his
brother
take
the
blame
setting
in
motion
the
deaths
of
Oberyn
Martell
and
Tywin
Lannister
Satisfied
at
his
horror
Olenna
insists
that
he
tell
Cersei
that
she
was
the
one
who
murdered
her
son
a

storylines
do

in
this
episode
With
the
appearance
of
Casterly
Rock
and
Highgarden
in
this
episode
every
regional
capital
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
has
appeared
onscreen
at
least
once
except
for
Storms
End
and
Sunspear
Each
of
the
nine
regions
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
has
also
appeared
at
least
once
the
seven
original
kingdoms
plus
the
capital
region
of
the
Crownlands
plus
the
border
region
of
the
Riverlands
It
was
intended
for
Storms
End
to
appear
in
Season
but
due
to
budget
limits
it
did
not
though
characters
do
state
in
dialogue
that
they
are
in
the
Stormlands
when
at
Renlys
army
camp
by
the
coast
Meanwhile
the
TV
series
didnt
actually
depict
Dornes
capital
Sunspear
onscreen
simply
a
truncated
version
of
the
Water
Gardens
a
nearby
private
retreat
of
House
Martell
This
is
also
the
first
time
that
a
named
location
from
The
Westerlands
has
been
depicted
onscreen
Robb
Stark
did
invade
the
north
of
the
Westerlands
in
Season
in
a
failed
attempt
to
lure
Tywin
west
but
only
his
army
camp
or
battlefields
actually
appeared
onscreen
not
specific
castles
ie
The
Crag
and
Golden
Tooth
were
mentioned
but
not
shown
onscreen
The
appearance
of
both
Oldtown
and
Highgarden
here
actually
make
this
the
first
time
that
two
separate
locations
in
the
Reach
have
appeared
within
the
same
episode
In
the
Inside
the
Episode
video
for
the
preceding
episode
showrunners
Benioff
and
Weiss
praised
that
the
four
major
political
figures
at
Daeneryss
council
scene
on
Dragonstone
were
all
women
Daenerys
herself
and
her
allies
Yara
Greyjoy
Ellaria
Sand
and
Olenna
Tyrell
who
all
joined
her
faction
in
the
Season
finale
Within
a
single
episode
all
of
these
female
political
allies
have
been
swept
away
Yara
and
Ellaria
captured
and
now
Olenna
defeated
and
forced
to
commit
suicide
In
this
episode
Cersei
partly
avenges
the
deaths
of
Joffrey
and
Myrcella
In
both
cases
the
revenge
is
performed
in
the
same
manner
of
the
respective
murder
Olenna
drinks
a
poisoned
wine
and
Tyene
is
poisoned
by
kissing
In
Kings
Landing
Tychos
conversation
with
Cersei
is
similiar
to
the
conversation
he
had
with
Stannis
Baratheon
and
Davos
Seaworth
He
first
used
diplomatic
words
and
then
changed
to
direct
facts
when
debts
and
loans
were
discussed
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
He
also
states
that
the
Iron
Bank
does
not
engage
in
betting
andor
gambling
The
Dance
of
Dragons
Tycho
Nestoriss
admission
that
Daeneryss
efforts
to
end
the
slave
trade
have
harmed
the
investments
of
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
is
problematic
since
Braavos
was
founded
by
exslaves
The
city
has
vehemently
opposed
slavery
for
centuries
and
unlike
even
Westeros
has
launched
antislaving
campaigns
against
other
powers
in
the
Known
World
Braavos
even
forced
the
nearby
Free
Cities
such
as
Pentos
to
outlaw
slavery
Although
Pentos
and
the
others
found
loopholes
to
allow
the
practice
to
continue
all
the
Free
Cities
in
Bravvoss
sphere
of
influence
nominally
outlaw
the
practice
to
this
day
A
question
unaddressed
even
in
the
novels
is
that
seven
out
of
the
nine
Free
Cities
still
practice
slavery
while
the
Iron
Bank
is
said
to
be
the
biggest
bank
in
the
entire
region
bigger
than
the
banks
of
the
other
eight
combined
thus
it
is
so
enmeshed
in
the
economies
of
the
other
seven
that
it
unclear
how
Braavos
could
lend
money
to
these
other
Free
Cities
without
it
being
at
least
indirectly
influenced
by
the
slave
trade
For
example
if
the
Iron
Bank
gives
loans
to
Myrish
lace
manufacturers
Myr
uses
a
large
slave
population
as
laborers
Slavery
is
illegal
in
Westeros
too
but
characters
in
Kings
Landing
are
described
as
wearing
fine
lace
imported
from
Myr
probably
made
with
slave
labor
or
indirectly
benefitting
from
it
The
novels
do
mention
that
Daeneryss
initial
actions
in
the
Liberation
of
Slavers
Bay
had
farreaching
economic
rippleeffects
slaves
were
the
one
major
export
of
that
region
and
without
it
their
local
economy
is
suffering
as
are
the
economies
of
their
importers
It
is
unclear
exactly
what
the
TV
writers
meant
by
this
exchange
if
they
were
implying
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
is
directly
involved
in
the
slave
trade
which
severely
contradicts
the
books
and
even
their
own
materials
which
say
slavery
is
outlawed
in
Braavos
or
if
they
just
mean
that
disrupting
the
slave
trade
had
ripple
effects
throughout
the
local
economies
across
all
of
Essos
The
conversation
between
Tycho
and
Cersei
is
perhaps
based
on
two
scenes
of
the
fifth
novel
in
both
people
complain
that
the
disruption
of
slave
trade
by
Daenerys
has
negative
applications
on
worldwide
economy
Xaro
who
is
alive
in
the
books
tells
that
to
Daenerys
while
Tyrion
and
Haldon
hear
the
same
from
a
custom
officer
named
Qavo
Cersei
tries
to
persuade
Tycho
that
the
Iron
Bank
shouldnt
trust
Daenerys
because
she
has
dragons
Braavos
was
founded
by
escaped
slaves
fleeing
the
dragonlords
of
Old
Valyria
Actually
in
the
books
there
is
a
chapter
from
the
fifth
novel
ADWD
Jon
IX
in
which
Tycho
talks
with
Jon
Snow
at
the
Wall
and
mentions
queer
talk
of
dragons
in
the
east
Jon
tries
to
make
light
of
it
but
Tycho
gravely
tells
him
he
wouldnt
joke
about
this
because
his
people
fled
the
dragonlords
Ultimately
though
Daenerys
is
very
much
the
opposite
of
her
Valyrian
ancestors
a
dragonlord
who
frees
slaves
instead
of
taking
them
It
is
unclear
how
the
Iron
Bank
will
react
to
her
in
the
books
as
a
result
they
would
approve
of
her
antislavery
activities
but
have
a
great
distaste
for
dragonlords
Tycho
seems
more
wary
and
frightened
of
Daenerys
than
welcoming
when
he
describes
her
to
Jon
Tychos
comments
about
the
Faith
Militant
are
surprising
since
Braavos
has
numerous
temples
He
may
have
just
been
attempting
to
flatter
Cersei
as
right
after
that
she
cuts
him
off
and
says
hes
really
just
here
to
get
his
gold
back
Then
again
the
Iron
Bank
doesnt
mind
lending
money
to
foreign
religions
or
cults
provided
that
they
pay
them
back
while
the
Faith
Militant
was
very
austere
and
didnt
believe
in
luxury
items
etc
It
is
unclear
if
the
Iron
Bank
will
frown
upon
their
takeover
in
the
books
The
general
points
Cersei
argues
to
Tycho
have
some
vague
basis
in
truth
dragonlords
and
Dothraki
have
historically
tended
to
just
take
what
they
want
through
conquest
not
concerned
with
paying
back
banks
for
old
debts
Former
slaves
also
dont
feel
inclined
to
pay
off
the
debts
of
their
former
masters
even
if
Braavos
is
antislavery
It
is
always
possible
that
Tycho
was
simply
playing
along
with
Cerseis
argument
about
Daeneryss
antislavery
efforts
given
that
he
also
feigned
interest
in
stopping
the
Faith
Militant
even
though
Cersei
said
he
didnt
really
care
about
that
But
that
verges
on
fan
speculation
future
episodes
will
need
to
show
how
this
plays
out
At
the
end
of
the
fifth
and
most
recent
novel
the
Iron
Bank
has
actually
switched
its
support
from
Cersei
to
Stannis
Baratheon
offering
to
extend
loans
for
him
Stannis
intends
to
use
those
funds
to
hire
a
huge
new
army
of
mercenaries
from
the
Free
Cities
though
it
is
uncertain
those
reinforcements
can
be
hired
and
brought
to
the
battlefield
in
time
The
bank
does
this
because
it
has
totally
lost
faith
in
Cerseis
ability
to
lead
after
a
string
of
debacles
and
on
top
of
this
was
insulted
when
she
simply
brushed
its
envoy
Noho
Dimittis
aside
and
announced
she
wouldnt
attempt
to
pay
the
bank
back
for
the
indefinite
duration
of
the
ongoing
rebellions
against
her
How
the
bank
will
respond
in
future
books
is
unclear
however
as
Stannis
is
still
alive
in
the
novels
but
not
in
the
TV
series
ie
if
given
a
pure
choice
between
Cersei
or
Daenerys
it
is
uncertain
how
it
would
respond
Cersei
makes
some
token
lipservice
at
a
coverstory
for
the
Destruction
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
in
a
massive
wildfire
explosion
claiming
to
Tycho
that
it
was
just
a
tragic
accident
which
happened
to
involve
a
gathering
of
many
of
her
political
enemies
at
a
trial
she
was
supposed
to
attend
It
doesnt
appear
Tycho
believes
it
or
for
that
matter
that
Cersei
expects
anyone
to
believe
that
Even
Hot
Pie
a
common
baker
in
the
Riverlands
at
an
inn
has
heard
that
it
was
Cersei
who
blew
up
the
Great
Sept
Something
similar
happened
in
the
novels
there
was
really
no
possible
way
that
the
Freys
could
spin
the
Red
Wedding
as
anything
other
than
a
sacrilegious
violation
of
guest
right
so
they
actually
started
claiming
that
Robb
Stark
and
his
soldiers
started
turning
into
werewolves
and
the
Freys
killed
them
in
selfdefense
things
like
werewolves
dont
exist
in
the
relatively
realistic
medieval
setting
of
Westeros
they
even
claim
that
Wendel
Manderly
was
killed
by
Robb
while
shielding
Lord
Frey
with
his
body
and
insolently
tell
that
lie
in
the
presence
of
Wendels
father
People
who
hear
this
cover
story
conclude
that
theres
really
nothing
the
Freys
could
say
that
would
be
believable
so
it
seems
old
Lord
Walder
decided
he
might
as
well
come
up
with
a
flippantly
implausible
explanation
which
he
knows
full
well
no
one
will
actually
believe
just
to
be
more
insulting
Bernadette
the
handmaiden
copying
Cerseis
style
in
Season
and
copying
her
new
style
now
in
Season
Cerseis
handmaiden
played
by
Sara
Dylan
returns
in
this
episode
she
has
actually
been
a
background
recurring
character
since
Season
and
every
subsequent
season
except
for
Season
Shes
the
one
who
stumbled
upon
Sansa
flowering
in
Season
and
spied
on
Tyrion
and
Shae
in
Season
She
doesnt
actually
have
an
inuniverse
name
but
is
credited
as
Bernadette
which
isnt
an
inuniverse
Westerosstyle
name
apparently
after
one
of
the
TV
shows
producers
Bernadette
Caulfield
Cerseis
handmaiden
Bernadette
has
switched
her
clothing
to
emulate
Cerseis
new
style
short
cut
hair
and
black
masculine
robes
No
one
would
want
to
show
up
Cersei
by
wearing
longer
hair
than
her
after
it
was
forcibly
shorn
off
by
the
Faith
Militant
Cersei
shifted
to
black
as
a
mourning
color
for
her
father
and
children
and
she
wears
a
lot
of
metal
armorlike
pieces
imitating
her
fathers
appearance
in
some
ways
Cerseis
handmaidens
copying
her
new
clothing
style
is
consistent
with
the
trickle
down
principle
of
fashion
that
Michele
Clapton
established
for
Westerosi
high
society
and
which
has
been
visible
onscreen
throughout
the
TV
series
see
Costumes
The
Seven
Kingdoms
In
this
case
of
course
there
is
a
greater
element
of
selfpreservation
in
dressing
like
Cersei
than
ever
before
The
question
arises
that
at
least
a
year
may
have
passed
since
Cerseis
hair
was
shorn
by
the
Faith
Militant
in
the
Season
finale
but
Cerseis
hair
is
still
short
its
slightly
longer
than
when
they
cropped
it
close
to
her
head
but
otherwise
has
stayed
in
a
close
pixiecut
The
answer
might
simply
be
that
Cersei
is
intentionally
keeping
her
hair
short
now
This
actually
would
fit
her
backstory
as
she
explained
in
both
the
books
and
Season
s
Blackwater
she
resents
being
a
woman
and
wishes
she
was
seen
the
same
as
a
powerful
man
like
her
father
Even
her
other
clothing
is
imitating
Tywins
costume
style
Thus
this
may
be
Cersei
intentionally
trying
to
shed
the
trappings
of
femininity
which
she
perceives
as
a
weakness
In
the
books
its
said
that
she
and
Jaime
would
look
like
mirror
images
of
each
other
if
she
cut
her
hair
to
the
point
that
when
they
were
small
children
they
would
play
a
game
on
their
castle
servants
by
swapping
clothes
and
pretending
to
be
each
other
who
truly
couldnt
tell
the
difference
and
she
was
fascinated
by
how
differently
the
servants
treated
her
when
they
thought
she
was
Jaime
Cersei
is
an
extreme
narcissist
and
in
some
ways
its
implied
that
she
has
sex
with
Jaime
because
its
almost
like
having
sex
with
a
mirror
image
of
herself
The
episodes
description
Cersei
returns
a
gift
refers
to
her
poisoning
Tyene
Sand
with
the
Long
Farewell
via
a
kiss
the
same
method
Ellaria
had
used
to
poison
Myrcella
Baratheon
in
the
Season
finale
Mothers
Mercy
Before
poisoning
Tyene
the
same
way
that
Ellaria
did
Myrcella
Cersei
regales
Ellaria
as
to
how
she
fed
Myrcella
at
her
own
breast
when
she
was
a
babe
and
wouldnt
let
the
wet
nurse
touch
her
a
sentiment
shared
by
Oberyn
Martell
about
his
sister
Elia
Martell
and
her
children
Two
Swords
There
is
no
mention
in
the
novels
that
Cersei
insisted
on
breastfeeding
Myrcella
herself
In
general
Cersei
hardly
paid
any
attention
to
Myrcella
and
Tommen
Joffrey
has
always
been
her
favorite
child
It
does
not
mean
Cersei
never
cared
for
her
other
children
her
reactions
to
Myrcellas
departure
and
to
the
news
about
the
nearfatal
attempt
on
her
life
show
that
Cersei
at
least
thinks
she
loves
her
daughter
though
in
the
books
its
more
of
a
narcissistic
view
of
Myrcella
as
one
of
her
possessions
Cersei
repeats
the
boast
the
Euron
made
in
the
Season
premiere
that
he
is
the
best
ship
captain
on
the
Fourteen
Seas
Again
this
isnt
a
term
from
the
novels
though
being
a
fictional
fantasy
world
theres
no
reason
for
them
to
have
an
exact
equivalent
for
the
phrase
seven
seas
from
real
life
In
fact
it
might
not
actually
refer
to
fourteen
distinct
bodies
of
water
the
real
life
term
seven
seas
doesnt
necessarily
refer
to
seven
actual
bodies
of
water
either
seven
is
just
a
luckyprime
number
that
is
alliterative
with
seas
so
the
TV
writers
may
have
picked
fourteen
because
it
is
assonant
with
sea
Euron
triumphantly
rides
his
horse
into
the
throne
room
after
winning
a
great
victory
just
as
Tywin
Lannister
did
in
the
Season
finale
after
winning
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
After
tormenting
Ellaria
and
poisoning
her
daughter
in
the
dungeons
Cersei
becomes
sexually
aroused
and
launches
into
having
sex
with
Jaime
Aerys
II
Targaryen
himself
would
often
become
sexually
aroused
after
burning
his
perceived
enemies
to
death
after
which
he
would
force
himself
on
his
own
wife
Queen
Rhaella
Cersei
already
destroyed
a
large
number
of
her
enemies
using
wildfire
as
the
Mad
King
did
when
he
burned
Rickard
Stark
alive
with
it
Thus
her
sexual
arousal
at
tormenting
her
enemies
is
another
of
the
increasing
parallels
between
Cersei
and
the
Mad
King
In
the
fourth
book
Cersei
becomes
aroused
when
she
watches
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
being
destroyed
by
wildfire
at
her
command
no
one
is
harmed
though
Jaime
notices
that
expression
and
is
filled
with
disgust
and
disquiet
vividly
recalling
who
used
to
react
the
same
way
Aerys
Cersei
has
become
so
openly
tyrannical
that
she
doesnt
care
if
the
servants
in
the
Red
Keep
know
that
shes
having
incestuous
sex
with
her
own
brother
Jaime
in
fact
flaunting
it
by
making
it
a
point
to
open
the
door
for
one
when
she
didnt
need
to
then
outright
saying
we
need
new
sheets
after
having
sex
There
are
points
in
the
novels
where
Jaime
and
Cersei
engage
in
the
idle
fantasy
that
they
could
just
proclaim
that
theyre
like
the
old
Targaryen
kings
that
wed
brother
to
sister
there
is
some
precedent
for
that
in
their
world
but
dont
seriously
try
because
theyre
not
Targaryens
and
even
the
Targaryens
only
managed
to
grudgingly
get
the
Faith
to
accept
their
incestuous
marriages
after
a
string
of
major
rebellions
while
theyre
barely
holding
on
to
power
as
it
is
When
Cersei
arises
naked
out
of
their
bed
it
appears
that
a
body
double
is
used
note
that
the
camera
angle
shifts
just
as
she
rises
up
so
Lena
Headeys
face
is
never
actually
on
camera
during
the
full
nude
shot
Headey
previously
said
she
used
a
body
double
for
the
walk
of
shame
scene
in
the
Season
finale
because
the
character
is
supposed
to
remain
stoic
but
she
feared
shed
break
character
and
react
angrily
at
the
crowd
hurling
insults
and
filth
at
her
shes
in
private
in
this
scene
so
its
unknown
why
she
chose
one
again
this
time
though
ultimately
thats
up
to
her
discretion
Headey
was
still
recovering
from
her
second
pregnancy
when
Season
was
filmed
Ellaria
Sand
and
her
daughter
Tyene
do
not
have
any
speaking
lines
throughout
this
episode
other
than
Tyene
briefly
shouting
out
Mama
When
Cersei
confronts
them
in
the
dungeons
she
has
them
gagged
and
the
entire
scene
plays
off
of
their
nonverbal
emotive
reactions
After
Tyenes
infamously
derided
line
You
want
a
good
girl
but
you
need
the
bad
pussy
from
the
Season
finale
the
TV
series
apparently
made
it
a
point
to
avoid
giving
her
dialogue
she
has
no
speaking
lines
in
all
of
Season
and
was
even
going
to
talk
at
one
point
in
the
Season
finale
but
got
interrupted
by
Olenna
saying
no
one
wanted
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
Tyene
did
have
a
few
brief
lines
in
the
preceding
episode
before
the
battle
on
her
ship
Due
to
massive
alterations
to
the
Dorne
storyline
in
the
TV
show
it
is
unknown
how
any
of
these
TV
scenes
will
reflect
the
actual
events
in
future
novels
ie
Doran
Martell
Trystane
and
Areo
Hoathare
still
alive
Dorans
daughter
and
heir
Arianne
is
a
major
character
Doran
reveals
he
is
a
secret
Targaryen
loyalist
the
Sand
Snakes
thus
change
their
mind
about
Doran
and
follow
his
orders
loyally

Actress
Indira
Varma
Ellaria
revealed
in
a
postepisode
interview
that
while
Ellaria
is
presumed
to
still
be
alive
this
episode
marks
her
departure
from
the
TV
series
and
she
is
not
currently
intended
to
reappear
in
the
future
The
HBO
Viewers
Guide
update
for
this
episode
listed
Tyene
as
deceased
now
even
though
she
doesnt
die
on
camera
ie
it
is
physically
possible
that
it
could
take
days
for
the
poison
to
work
on
her
before
someone
gave
her
an
antidote
but
that
isnt
going
to
happen
Ellaria
is
still
listed
as
alive
While
the
TV
series
can
plausibly
make
the
tacit
assumption
that
any
minor
Tyrell
cousins
later
died
in
the
fall
of
Highgarden
it
is
impossible
for
the
entire
House
Martell
bloodline
to
be
extinct
even
in
the
TV
continuity
at
least
without
simply
making
an
official
retcon
In
Season
Oberyn
Martell
confirmed
that
there
are
eight
Sand
Snakes
all
his
daughters
by
various
women
just
as
in
the
books
Ellaria
is
the
mother
of
the
four
youngest
in
the
books
but
the
TV
show
changed
Tyene
to
be
her
daughter
nonetheless
it
remained
inconsistent
on
whether
she
was
now
the
mother
of
four
or
five
Sand
Snakes
in
the
TV
continuity
at
one
point
in
Season
Doran
said
she
was
mother
to
four
of
his
nieces
Tyene
and
three
others
Four
of
the
younger
ones
havent
been
introduced
by
name
in
the
TV
continuity
but
in
Season
Oberyn
even
mentioned
that
one
of
the
young
ones
is
named
Elia
Sand
after
his
late
sister
Elia
Martell
Thus
even
if
Ellaria
dies
Oberyn
should
still
have
five
living
daughters
It
appears
the
TV
writers
are
simply
wrapping
up
the
Dorne
subplots
as
quickly
as
possible
as
an
admission
of
failure
after
the
extremely
negative
critical
reception
that
their
truncated
adaptation
of
it
received
for
Season
Alexander
Siddig
Doran
Martell
even
confirmed
that
he
was
supposed
to
appear
in
four
episodes
of
Season
before
ultimately
being
killed
off
in
the
premiere
episode
As
such
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
TV
writers
might
not
be
bothering
to
develop
their
own
inuniverse
explanation
for
who
the
current
leader
of
Dorne
is
or
what
happened
to
all
branches
of
House
Martell
Jessica
Henwick
who
played
Nymeria
Sand
had
to
squeeze
in
her
brief
appearance
in
the
preceding
episode
around
her
new
schedule
as
a
lead
in
Marvels
Iron
Fist
series
Henwick
said
the
producers
told
her
that
if
she
couldnt
fit
it
into
her
schedule
they
wouldnt
even
bother
recasting
the
role
with
another
actor
and
simply
leave
the
characters
fate
unexplained
though
ultimately
she
was
able
to
make
it
in
The
lack
of
planning
around
Nymerias
fate
seems
to
reaffirm
that
the
TV
writers
simply
dont
want
to
expend
any
more
effort
tying
up
loose
narrative
ends
regarding
Dorne
The
ultimately
handling
of
the
Dorne
subplot
and
characters
from
the
books
was
received
very
poorly
by
critics
particularly
as
they
are
the
only
one
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
whose
people
are
nonwhite
said
in
its
review
for
this
episode
regarding
Ellaria
and
the
three
Sand
Snakes
I
also
cant
help
but
look
at
the
overall
treatment
of
these
women
on
this
show
and
this
being
their
cumulative
moment
These
four
women
of
color
were
brought
on
the
show
hyper
sexualized
dramatized
catty
to
no
end
and
violent
Then
we
watched
the
incredibly
damaging
racist
stereotyping
punished
spending
more
time
on
their
torturous
or
violent
deaths
than
was
ever
spent
on
trying
to
actual
characterize
and
develop
these
people
It
just
really
doesnt
sit
well
on
any
level
At
Winterfell
Bran
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
for
the
first
time
since
the
Season
finale
Similar
to
with
Jon
Snow
Sansa
Stark
didnt
actually
have
any
scenes
with
Bran
Stark
before
in
the
brief
period
when
they
were
both
together
at
Winterfell
in
the
first
two
episodes
of
the
TV
series
The
only
time
they
were
oncamera
together
was
when
the
Stark
household
gathered
in
the
courtyard
to
welcome
King
Roberts
arrival
Unlike
with
Jon
the
books
do
describe
Sansa
as
interacting
more
with
her
trueborn
brothers
offscreen
but
in
both
books
and
TV
series
Sansa
is
only
actively
depicted
in
scenes
with
Arya
Bran
says
that
he
is
the
ThreeEyed
Raven
now
after
the
previous
one
uploaded
all
of
his
memories
and
powers
to
him
This
appears
to
be
somewhat
like
the
Bene
Gesserit
Other
Memory
from
Frank
Herberts
Dune
chronicles
Bran
seems
detached
and
overwhelmed
by
this
vast
new
perspective
seeing
all
of
the
past
and
future
at
once
but
unable
to
process
it
all
yet
Sansa
is
frightened
that
he
can
recall
what
her
wedding
dress
at
Winterfell
looked
like
even
though
he
wasnt
there
Sansa
points
out
that
by
the
malepreference
primogeniture
laws
of
inheritance
in
Westeros
Bran
should
be
lord
of
Winterfell
and
the
North
due
to
being
Ned
Starks
last
trueborn
son
Note
that
this
means
she
freely
expresses
that
Bran
should
rule
Winterfell
instead
of
herself
even
though
Bran
is
her
younger
brother
both
of
them
always
knew
since
they
were
small
children
that
Bran
ranks
ahead
of
her
in
the
traditional
line
of
succession
and
she
doesnt
challenge
that
It
remains
to
be
seen
how
this
would
impact
Neds
alleged
bastard
son
Jon
Snow
ruling
but
Bran
surprises
Sansa
by
insisting
that
he
doesnt
want
to
be
a
lord
and
thinks
he
never
can
be
now
possibly
just
abdicating
his
position
After
being
told
they
have
provisions
to
feed
Winterfell
for
the
next
one
year
of
winter
possibly
a
little
more
Sansa
asks
Maester
Wolkan
what
the
longest
winter
in
the
past
years
was
and
he
says
hell
have
to
check
In
both
the
first
novel
and
Season
Tyrion
was
asked
how
many
winters
he
had
lived
through
and
which
was
the
longest
to
which
he
answered
that
he
had
lived
through
nine
winters
and
the
longest
was
the
one
he
was
born
in
which
lasted
three
years
The
TV
series
has
increased
Tyrions
age
a
few
years
so
the
span
this
occurred
in
is
a
little
different
but
from
this
and
other
evidence
the
pattern
loosely
holds
that
each
of
the
four
seasons
in
Westeros
while
variable
usually
lasts
around
one
or
two
years
three
year
long
seasons
only
happen
every
few
decades
and
a
decadelong
season
only
happens
every
century
or
so
Previously
in
Season
the
Pycelle
told
the
Small
Council
that
the
ten
year
long
summer
that
just
ended
was
the
longest
in
living
memory
It
was
also
brought
up
that
the
commoners
think
a
long
summer
will
be
followed
by
an
equally
long
winter
but
Pycelle
dismisses
this
as
just
superstition
they
really
cant
predict
how
long
new
seasons
will
be
Time
moves
more
slowly
in
the
TV
series
timeline
so
the
autumn
which
began
the
same
time
as
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
lasted
about
two
years
before
turning
into
winter
In
the
TV
series
this
autumn
lasted
five
years
The
books
have
more
explicit
scenes
of
characters
worrying
about
winter
provisions
autumn
is
when
they
harvest
and
store
crops
for
the
long
winter
but
instead
all
of
the
ablebodied
men
were
off
fighting
and
dying
in
the
war
and
the
burned
out
the
major
breadbasket
region
of
the
Riverlands
Recently
in
the
Season
premiere
episode
Jaime
also
expressed
concern
that
the
Lannisters
couldnt
keep
feeding
their
armies
unless
they
captured
the
remaining
grain
stores
in
the
Reach
Sansa
observes
that
the
steel
breastplates
that
some
of
the
blacksmiths
are
making
who
apparently
came
north
with
the
Vale
army
need
to
be
covered
in
leather
for
the
cold
The
costume
designers
have
explained
this
in
interviews
since
Season
metal
doesnt
retain
heat
well
and
additionally
exposed
metal
armor
in
freezing
temperatures
is
very
cold
so
it
will
actually
give
its
wearer
frostbite
burns
if
it
isnt
protected
with
a
layer
of
other
material
This
isnt
some
special
knowledge
Sansa
would
have
though
any
child
in
the
north
would
know
this
is
how
they
need
to
equip
for
the
cold
but
the
Vale
lords
arent
used
to
arming
for
a
northern
winter
Littlefingers
speech
to
Sansa
doesnt
appear
to
have
a
clear
objective
nor
has
he
been
presented
as
having
a
clear
goal
now
that
the
Vale
army
is
in
Winterfell
other
than
wanting
to
marry
Sansa
The
TV
version
cut
out
many
of
his
elaborate
and
wellplanned
schemes
from
the
novels
ie
in
the
books
he
never
married
off
Sansa
to
the
Boltons
presented
as
some
sort
of
plan
to
destroy
them
from
within
which
isnt
how
Marriage
works
in
Westeros
and
his
plan
was
to
have
Sansa
marry
Sweetrobin
Arryns
cousin
and
heir
Harrold
Hardyng
after
Sweetrobin
dies
Littlefinger
does
not
say
explicitly
whether
he
intends
to
help
Sweetrobin
die
though
it
is
implied
then
have
Sansa
reclaim
the
North
using
the
Vales
armies
What
Littlefinger
intends
to
do
after
that
however
is
unknown
as
openly
revolting
against
the
Iron
Throne
would
put
him
at
odds
with
Cersei
Baelish
may
have
been
attempting
to
cast
doubt
on
Jon
while
emphasizing
that
his
selfinterest
and
political
experience
are
more
realiable
that
Jons
idealism
Sansa
remarks
that
Cersei
killed
her
father
mother
and
brother
actually
Cersei
was
only
directly
involved
in
the
betrayal
of
her
father
Ned
and
responsible
for
his
death
at
Joffreys
order
due
to
inaction
Her
mother
Catelyn
and
brother
Robb
however
were
killed
at
the
Red
Wedding
and
Cersei
actually
wasnt
involved
in
planning
that
only
because
her
father
Tywin
planned
it
himself
and
didnt
think
Cersei
was
smart
enough
to
let
her
in
on
the
plan
Cersei
did
rejoice
at
the
deaths
of
Catelyn
and
Robb
however
and
broadly
the
Lannisters
as
a
whole
were
responsible
for
it
so
perhaps
Sansa
is
just
speaking
loosely
At
Dragonstone
The
full
introduction
Missandei
gives
in
this
episode
for
Daenerys
Targaryen
including
all
her
formal
titles
is
You
are
standing
in
the
presence
of
Daenerys
Stormborn
of
House
Targaryen
rightful
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne
rightful
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
the
Mother
of
Dragons
the
Khaleesi
of
the
Great
Grass
Sea
the
Unburnt
the
Breaker
of
Chains
This
differs
slightly
from
her
full
title
introduction
in
the
fifth
novel
which
is
Daenerys
Stormborn
the
Unburnt
Queen
of
Meereen
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Khaleesi
of
Great
Grass
Sea
Breaker
of
Shackles
and
Mother
of
Dragons
As
with
Cersei
in
the
preceding
episodes
the
TV
show
has
also
switched
back
to
omitting
the
Rhoynar
from
Queen
of
the
Andals
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
The
version
omitting
the
Rhoynar
was
used
since
Season
apparently
thinking
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
who
the
Rhoynar
were
ancestors
of
the
Dornish
even
though
Season
didnt
explain
in
dialogue
who
the
Andals
or
the
First
Men
were
either
In
Seasons
and
after
the
Dornish
were
introduced
the
TV
series
flipflopped
to
including
of
the
Rhoynar
or
not
inconsistently
from
episode
to
episode
There
is
no
King
of
Westeros
as
such
Westeros
is
the
entire
continent
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
everything
south
of
The
Wall
Thus
the
full
titles
used
by
male
monarchs
like
King
Robert
Baratheon
or
Joffrey
included
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
The
latter
of
these
is
a
specific
title
for
the
current
commander
of
all
the
realms
armies
which
is
usually
the
king
ex
officio
but
if
the
king
is
underaged
or
of
a
nonmartial
scholarly
bent
they
have
been
known
to
pass
the
title
to
some
other
trusted
commander
ie
as
Tommen
was
underaged
in
Season
Tywin
was
introduced
as
Protector
of
the
Realm
without
complaint
As
there
has
never
been
an
official
female
monarch
before
it
is
uncertain
what
the
female
variants
would
be
presumably
Lady
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
which
is
what
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
was
using
in
infoboxes
In
the
Season
premiere
however
Cerseis
letter
to
Jon
listed
her
title
as
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
apparently
a
combination
of
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
Daenerys
uses
the
same
title
now
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
so
apparently
the
TV
writers
didnt
intend
this
to
just
be
a
whim
of
Cersei
making
up
new
titles
Its
possible
that
the
TV
writers
thought
Lady
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
sounds
awkward
in
dialogue
Jon
Snow
says
that
Daenerys
Targaryens
father
the
Mad
King
burned
alive
his
grandfather
Rickard
Stark
and
his
uncle
Brandon
Stark
This
is
mistaken
the
Mad
King
burned
his
grandfather
alive
while
forcing
his
uncle
to
watch
while
Brandon
was
tied
by
his
neck
to
a
torture
device
to
intentionally
make
Brandon
strangle
himself
trying
to
break
free
to
help
his
father
This
is
a
bit
convoluted
so
Jon
could
be
just
speaking
loosely
in
anger
In
the
second
novel
Jaime
asks
Catelyn
if
she
knows
how
Rickard
and
Brandon
were
killed
She
answers
that
Brandon
was
strangled
but
does
not
know
how
Rickard
was
killed
Jaime
taunts
Catelyn
that
Ned
wished
to
spare
her
the
truth
and
tells
her
the
whole
story
without
omitting
even
one
gruesome
detail
It
can
be
assumed
that
Catelyn
was
not
the
only
one
who
did
not
know
the
exact
details
of
the
double
execution
thus
Jons
mistake
is
understable
Daenerys
says
that
Jon
lost
two
brothers
presumably
referring
to
Robb
and
Rickon
Since
she
and
almost
every
one
else
except
Sam
Sansa
Theon
Jon
and
the
occupants
of
Castle
Black
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
Bran
survived
she
should
have
said
that
Jon
lost
three
brothers
In
the
TV
version
Jon
learned
that
Bran
had
escaped
the
burning
of
Winterfell
but
hasnt
heard
anything
about
him
in
three
years
and
may
still
fear
he
is
dead
The
TV
series
largely
avoided
the
issue
of
what
people
thought
happened
to
Bran
after
Rickon
was
confirmed
to
have
escaped
too
Its
unclear
why
Jon
doesnt
bring
up
that
he
had
the
confidence
of
the
last
known
living
Targaryen
before
Daenerys
her
greatuncle
Maester
Aemon
and
that
Aemon
himself
believed
their
reports
that
the
White
Walkers
have
returned
Davos
also
received
a
letter
from
Maester
Aemon
about
the
White
Walkers
and
hes
also
in
the
room
but
doesnt
mention
it
though
in
that
case
it
actually
wasnt
common
knowledge
that
Aemon
was
a
Targaryen
so
it
could
plausibly
be
explained
that
Davos
was
simply
unaware
of
their
connection
Jon
and
Daenerys
explicitly
bring
up
some
of
the
history
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
mentioning
by
name
that
Torrhen
Stark
was
the
last
of
the
original
Kings
in
the
North
who
bent
the
knee
to
Daeneryss
ancestor
Aegon
I
Targaryen
This
has
been
explained
in
the
animated
Histories
Lore
featurettes
since
Season
By
the
time
Torrhen
was
able
to
muster
all
the
diverse
armies
of
the
North
from
across
their
vast
territories
Aegon
had
already
conquered
all
of
southern
Westeros
demonstrating
at
the
Field
of
Fire
that
no
regular
army
could
stand
against
his
dragons
he
also
joined
the
surviving
strength
of
all
the
defeated
kingdoms
to
his
own
When
Torrhen
finally
reached
the
south
and
saw
Aegons
vast
power
he
realized
that
fighting
was
pointless
the
North
needs
every
man
it
has
to
survive
its
deadly
winters
and
wildling
invasions
so
he
surrendered
without
a
fight
As
a
result
historians
like
Maester
Yandel
have
pointed
out
that
the
Targaryens
never
truly
defeated
the
North
they
surrendered
voluntarily
Daenerys
states
to
Jon
that
the
realm
had
seen
centuries
of
peace
when
a
Targaryan
had
sat
on
the
Iron
Throne
and
a
Stark
had
been
Warden
of
the
North
However
Westeros
has
in
fact
endured
numerous
wars
and
rebellions
throughout
the
Targaryan
dynasty
ie
The
Dance
of
The
Dragons
The
Blackfyre
Rebellions
The
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
etc
Its
possible
of
course
that
Daenerys
was
simply
glossing
over
those
conflicts
Notably
one
possible
meaning
is
that
many
of
those
conflicts
spanned
decades
apart
from
each
other
and
were
nowhere
near
as
devastating
as
compared
to
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
When
Jon
Snow
and
Tyrion
Lannister
walk
up
the
steps
to
Dragonstone
castle
they
recount
that
Tyrion
pissed
off
the
top
of
The
Wall
in
Season
s
Lord
Snow
and
that
Tyrion
was
dismissive
of
the
existence
of
the
White
Walkers
at
the
time
saying
that
the
Nights
Watch
only
defends
against
Grumpkins
and
Snarks
which
are
imaginary
creatures
Season
s
The
Kingsroad
Tyrion
defends
that
back
in
Season
White
Walkers
were
just
the
stuff
of
legends
no
one
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
believe
in
them
but
Jon
saw
them
and
so
did
Mormont
This
is
referring
to
how
Tyrion
received
a
letter
from
Lord
Commander
Jeor
Mormont
sent
to
the
Small
Council
in
Kings
Landing
back
in
the
Season
premiere
warning
that
the
White
Walkers
had
returned
The
North
Remembers
All
of
them
scoffed
at
it
though
Tyrion
having
met
Jeor
who
seemed
a
serious
man
not
prone
to
fantasy
seemed
slightly
perturbed
at
the
time
Tyrion
and
Davos
Seaworth
also
note
that
they
fought
on
opposite
sides
of
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
in
Season
s
Blackwater
Tyrion
asks
Jon
if
Sansa
Stark
is
safe
bringing
up
that
they
are
still
technically
married
though
as
Tyrion
himself
dismisses
it
was
a
sham
marriage
they
were
both
forced
into
and
which
he
refused
to
consummate
after
their
wedding
in
Season
s
Second
Sons
Divorce
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
but
annulment
does
though
unlike
Littlefinger
said
in
High
Sparrow
it
is
not
done
automatically
it
has
to
be
granted
with
special
permission
from
the
Faith
of
the
Sevens
hierarchy
and
only
for
specific
reasons
if
the
marriage
was
unconsummated
if
it
was
actually
bigamous
because
one
of
them
was
already
married
etc
In
the
fourth
novel
Littlefinger
intends
to
marry
Sansa
to
Harrold
Hardyng
Sansa
reminds
him
she
is
still
married
Littlefinger
assures
her
it
is
not
a
problemfor
this
is
only
a
betrothal
the
actual
marriage
will
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
He
does
not
bring
up
the
option
of
annulment

long
low
winding
stair
path
that
leads
from

gates

walk
up

in
San
Juan
Spain
made
without
any
CGI
extensions
When
Jon
and
Tyrion
are
walking
to
the
castle
and
remark
that
he
is
not
a
Stark
meaning
that
hes
a
bastard
with
the
surname
Snow
they
are
interrupted
by
the
Targaryen
dragons
which
is
of
course
a
doubleentendre
that
Jons
father
was
secretly
a
Targaryen
Daenerys
pointedly
asks
Jon
if
his
father
Eddard
Stark
cared
that
Robert
Baratheon
would
send
assassins
after
her
and
her
brother
in
Essos
Neither
is
aware
that
this
deeply
troubled
Ned
to
the
point
that
he
would
have
resigned
as
Roberts
Hand
of
the
King
over
it
Rhaegar
Targaryens
small
children
Daeneryss
own
niece
and
nephew
were
killed
during
the
Sack
of
Kings
Landing
and
this
did
greatly
offend
Ned
causing
a
rift
with
Tywin
Lannister
for
allowing
it
which
never
healed
and
briefly
putting
him
at
odds
with
Robert
though
they
reconciled
in
their
shared
grief
a
few
weeks
later
after
they
discovered
that
Lyanna
had
died
Neds
sense
of
honor
in
refusing
to
go
along
with
killing
children
was
later
expressed
when
he
steadfastly
refused
to
kill
Cersei
and
her
children
even
though
this
mercy
was
political
suicide
Varys
knows
what
Neds
reaction
was
because
he
was
at
those
council
meetings
though
he
doesnt
happen
to
be
in
the
room
at
the
moment
and
apparently
hasnt
informed
Daenerys
of
it
before
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
also
knows
that
in
the
fifth
novel
he
tells
that
to
Daenerys
Daenerys
however
does
not
change
her
mind
about
the
Starks
she
regards
them
and
the
Lannisters
collectively
as
the
usurpers
dogs
The
exchange
in
the
Dragonstone
throne
room
makes
it
clear
that
it
isnt
common
knowledge
throughout
Westeros
that
Jon
died
and
was
resurrected
They
dont
have
a
modern
communication
network
but
just
vague
rumors
that
filter
across
the
continent
over
time
In
the
preceding
episode
Hot
Pie
was
aware
of
the
basic
outline
that
Jon
led
a
wildling
army
south
from
the
Wall
to
defeat
the
Boltons
but
not
about
his
resurrection
Apparently
its
so
fantastic
that
Jon
doesnt
try
to
advertise
it
because
he
doesnt
know
if
people
would
believe
it
and
it
would
sound
crazy
to
make
such
a
claim
without
evidence
as
seen
here
The
exact
circumstances
of
how
he
left
the
Nights
Watch
to
become
King
in
the
North
thus
still
arent
widespread
knowledge
Daenerys
quips
that
she
didnt
receive
a
formal
education
She
was
just
an
exile
on
the
run
throughout
her
childhood
without
a
true
home
bouncing
from
one
patron
to
the
next
with
her
brother
until
the
novelty
of
their
presence
wore
off
and
theyd
have
to
go
begging
somewhere
else
She
wasnt
taught
by
a
maester
in
a
castle
like
many
great
lords
though
she
is
a
quick
study
and
very
intelligent
The
novels
make
this
more
clear
the
history
books
about
Westeros
that
Jorah
gave
her
at
her
wedding
were
the
first
time
shed
had
access
to
thorough
information
about
Westeros
For
most
of
her
life
all
she
had
to
go
on
was
her
brother
Viseryss
skewed
view
of
events
Daenerys
explicitly
describes
being
sold
off
to
the
Dothraki
like
a
broodmare
and
her
wedding
night
with
Drogo
as
Rape
This
was
a
change
from
books
to
TV
series
though
somewhat
grey
in
the
book
version
Daenerys
does
remark
in
later
books
that
Viserys
tried
to
buy
an
army
with
her
virginity
and
she
was
sold
off
like
a
horse
but
she
actually
fell
in
love
with
Drogo
In
the
book
version
of
their
wedding
night
however
she
resists
him
at
first
but
then
says
yes
as
they
have
sex
and
the
term
rape
was
not
applied
to
it
as
such
due
to
being
a
premodern
society
without
a
definition
of
marital
rape
On
top
of
this
she
was
years
old
at
the
time
in
the
books
though
considered
of
marriageable
age
because
she
had
had
begun
flowering
Perhaps
to
sidestep
the
controversy
that
would
have
arisen
from
trying
to
defend
this
as
not
being
rape
the
TV
show
changed
it
to
actually
depict
her
wedding
night
as
rape
and
the
showrunners
refer
to
it
as
rape
in
their
Bluray
commentary
George
RR
Martin
later
said
in
interviews
that
the
original
version
they
filmed
in
the
unaired
pilot
episode
was
the
same
as
the
books
with
a
different
actress
before
Daenerys
was
recast
but
that
the
final
version
was
changed
to
depict
it
as
rape
with
Daenerys
not
in
a
position
of
control
only
consenting
in
a
situation
of
duress
Martin
was
guarded
in
his
comments
and
said
that
if
anyone
wanted
to
know
why
the
change
was
made
they
would
have
to
ask
showrunners
Benioff
and
Weiss
because
it
wasnt
his
idea
see
the
pilot
episode

for
more
information
Continuing
from
the
first
two
episodes
Daeneryss
new
costume
style
has
shifted
to
the
old
Targaryen
style
that
her
brother
Viserys
wore
back
in
Season
with
a
few
touches
from
the
other
styles
she
had
in
her
travels
On
formal
occasions
such
as
her
wedding
Viserys
would
embellish
his
tunic
with
a
short
ceremonial
cape
pinned
to
one
shoulder
Daenerys
didnt
have
the
short
pinned
cape
in
the
first
two
episodes
of
this
season
while
she
was
traveling
but
to
receive
Jon
Snow
in
this
episode
she
wears
her
full
formal
regalia
including
a
short
red
cape
pinned
to
one
shoulder
like
Viserys
Notice
the
delicate
embroidery
pattern
on
it
meant
to
be
reminiscent
of
dragonscales

Tyrion
prefaces
his
advice
to
Daenerys
by
saying
a
wise
man
once
said
and
she
accuses
that
hes
just
making
that
up
This
is
something
of
a
running
gag
last
season
in
Oathbreaker
he
prefaced
a
different
remark
with
a
wise
man
once
said
then
Missandei
asked
which
man
it
was
who
said
that
and
he
quipped
Me
just
now
Tyrion
explicitly
brings
up
that
the
nomenclature
of
fighting
an
army
of
undead
wights
can
be
confusing
are
wights
killed
by
fire
given
that
theyre
already
dead
or
destroyed
by
fire
Tyrion
doesnt
dwell
on
the
issue
This
is
one
of
the
few
episodes
in
which
all
three
of
Daeneryss
dragons
are
referred
to
by
name
in
dialogue
Drogon
Rhaegal
and
Viserion
Despite
hatching
in
the
closing
scene
of
Season
it
wasnt
until
Season
that
all
three
of
their
names
were
spoken
aloud
onscreen
Drogons
name
was
given
in
Season
the
other
two
in
Season
The
HBO
website
for
the
TV
series
did
list
their
names
since
Season
but
casual
viewers
wouldnt
have
known
it
the
TV
writers
said
they
felt
it
was
awkward
to
fit
in
a
scene
in
which
a
character
would
point
out
all
three
of
their
names
for
the
benefit
of
the
audience
which
is
what
Daenerys
and
her
followers
do
for
Jon
in
this
episode
This
is
also
the
first
time
that
the
TV
show
has
directly
explained
that
Daenerys
named
two
of
the
dragons
explicitly
after
her
two
dead
brothers
Rhaegal
for
Rhaegar
Targaryen
who
died
before
she
was
born
and
who
was
Jons
secret
biological
father
and
Viserion
for
her
brother
Viserys
Drogon
of
course
is
named
after
Khal
Drogo
Daenerys
ponders
trying
to
hunt
down
Euron
Greyjoys
fleet
with
her
dragons
Wooden
ships
are
indeed
quite
vulnerable
to
dragons
as
seen
at
the
Second
Siege
of
Meereen
last
season
and
at
historical
battles
such
as
the
Battle
of
the
Gullet
this
may
be
why
Euron
relied
on
surprise
attack
in
the
Narrow
Sea
and
hasnt
attempted
to
directly
assault
Dragonstone
island
itself
Cersei
was
also
presented
with
an
antidragon
ballista
in
the
preceding
episode
bringing
up
the
issue
that
an
adult
dragons
only
real
weak
spot
is
its
eyes
in
historical
battles
opposing
forces
figured
out
in
past
centuries
that
fundamentally
a
dragons
real
weak
spot
is
of
course
its
human
rider
who
can
be
killed
with
conventional
weapons
if
theyre
not
careful
Melisandre
openly
admits
that
sacrificing
Shireen
Baratheon
was
a
horrible
mistake
and
she
is
done
trying
to
directly
influence
events
having
finally
brought
ice
Jon
Snow
and
fire
Daenerys
Targaryen
together
This
is
of
course
a
reference
to
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
and
inuniverse
to
The
Prince
That
Was
Promised
about
whom
it
was
said
in
the
books
that
his
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire
Melisandres
statement
that
she
has
seen
a
vision
in
the
flames
that
she
and
Varys
will
die
in
Westeros
sooner
or
later
hasnt
been
made
in
the
novels
though
all
men
must
die
eventually
and
she
didnt
mention
in
what
context
they
will
die
Her
statement
whispering
in
the
ears
of
kings
is
a
direct
barb
towards
Varys
he
was
known
for
literally
whispering
in
Aerys
II
Targaryens
ear
during
the
closing
days
of
Roberts
Rebellion
leading
many
to
question
exactly
whose
side
he
was
on
His
formal
title
as
the
royal
spymaster
was
in
fact
Master
of
Whisperers
Interestingly
Melisandre
indicates
that
she
intends
to
make
for
Volantis
rather
than
return
to
Asshai
Its
not
clear
whether
she
intends
to
go
there
to
meet
with
Kinvara
and
the
largest
concentration
of
Red
Priests
west
of
the
Jade
Sea
or
if
it
is
simply
her
first
stop
on
a
longer
journey
Either
way
she
makes
it
clear
that
she
will
return
to
Westeros
to
face
her
death
Davos
Seaworth
selfdeprecatingly
notes
that
he
has
a
Flea
Bottom
accent
that
is
a
lowerclass
accent
as
he
grew
up
in
the
slum
district
called
Flea
Bottom
in
Kings
Landing
He
also
remarks
that
he
isnt
familiar
with
Missandeis
accent
so
he
doesnt
know
where
shes
from
It
is
mentioned
in
passing
in
the
novels
that
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros
the
language
of
the
Andals
has
various
regional
as
well
as
class
accents
but
George
RR
Martin
didnt
develop
them
in
specific
detail
because
he
isnt
a
trailed
linguist
Class
accents
are
a
bit
more
prominent
than
regional
accents
in
the
text
ie
lower
class
people
speak
in
a
less
refined
register
than
welleducated
aristocrats
Davos
wasnt
sure
where
Missandei
is
from
so
she
explains
that
she
is
from
Naath
island
which
is
off
the
coast
of
Sothoryos
the
third
continent
beside
Westeros
and
Essos
and
their
fantasy
analogue
of
Africa
Davos
says
hes
heard
its
beautiful
with
palm
trees
and
butterflies
Davos
is
apparently
trying
to
be
friendly
and
isnt
patronizing
her
that
is
if
Jon
said
hed
heard
of
Naath
and
its
nice
he
would
be
politely
lying
Davos
in
contrast
was
an
oceangoing
smuggler
in
the
Narrow
Sea
for
many
years
encountered
many
merchants
pirates
and
travelers
from
across
the
Free
Cities
who
themselves
voyaged
throughout
the
Summer
Sea
so
its
entirely
probable
that
he
heard
of
Naath
at
some
point
in
the
past
This
is
only
the
second
time
that
Naath
has
been
described
in
some
detail
since
Missandei
was
introduced
in
Season
it
has
been
mentioned
since
but
only
in
the
context
of
her
introducing
herself
as
Missandei
from
the
isle
of
Naath
The
first
time
it
was
described
was
in
Season
s
Oathbreaker
when
Grey
Worm
asked
if
she
remembered
what
it
was
like
and
she
said
she
remembered
the
tall
trees
and
sandy
beaches
Davoss
description
of
Naath
is
what
a
tradersmuggler
would
have
heard
about
the
island
from
most
people
The
island
is
known
for
the
butterfly
plague
so
people
would
not
land
on
the
island
Crews
sailing
by
would
see
the
trees
and
beaches
Davos
mentions
hes
heard
about
the
beautiful
palm
trees
and
butterflies
on
Naath
In
the
books
it
is
indeed
famous
for
its
butterflies
to
the
point
that
it
is
often
called
Naath
the
Isle
of
Butterflies
While
beautiful
however
the
butterflies
are
carriers
for
a
deadly
and
horrific
plague
which
kills
any
outsiders
who
visit
the
island
if
they
stay
more
than
a
few
hours
The
indigenous
Naathi
people
are
immune
to
the
butterfly
fever
and
this
protected
them
from
foreign
invasion
for
many
centuries
but
eventually
foreign
slavers
figured
out
that
the
butterflies
are
only
active
in
the
day
so
they
could
avoid
it
by
raiding
the
island
for
slaves
at
night
The
Title
sequence
for
the
TV
series
puts
the
sigil
of
a
characters
House
next
to
their
actors
name
ie
a
lion
for
Lena
Headey
Cersei
Lannister
They
make
up
sigils
for
other
characters
who
arent
from
noble
Houses
or
for
production
staff
for
Nathalie
Emmanuel
Missandei
the
title
sequence
uses
a
butterfly
as
her
personalized
sigil
According
to
linguist
David
J
Peterson
when
Daenerys
orders
her
guard
to
escort
Jon
and
Davos
to
their
chambers
the
unsubtitled
line
she
gives
in
Dothraki
is
simply
Escort
these
men
to
their
rooms
Treat
them
well
but
keep
an
eye
on
them

Peterson
said
the
line
was
meant
to
be
subtitled
and
he
wasnt
sure
why
it
wasnt
saying
it
wasnt
really
important
enough
to
be
subtitled
in
the
first
place
but
it
also
wasnt
significant
enough
that
there
was
some
need
to
remove
the
subtitles
either
Tyrion
tells
DaenerysApparently
it
dragonglass
can
be
turned
into
weapons
that
kill
White
Walkers
and
their
undead
foot
soldiers
As
explained
in
the
notes
for
the
preceding
episode
when
Jon
stated
this
at
Winterfell
in
the
books
dragonglass
can
only
kill
White
Walkers
not
their
wights
but
TV
writer
Dave
Hill
stated
in
an
interview
that
this
is
an
official
change
from
books
to
TV
series
not
merely
an
oversight
While
talking
to
Jon
Tyrion
says
Why
dont
you
figure
out
what
to
do
about
my
missing
fleet
and
murdered
allies
and
Ill
figure
out
what
to
do
about
your
walking
dead
men
which
most
probably
is
a
reference
to
another
popular
series
featuring
zombies
In
the
Westerlands
Casterly
Rock
appears
for
the
first
time
in
this
episode
In
the
books
it
is
built
on
a
much
bigger
scale
George
RR
Martins
said
that
Casterly
Rock
was
inspired
by
the
reallife
Rock
of
Gilbraltar
a
large
mountain
near
the
coast
Casterly
Rock
isnt
just
a
castle
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
but
a
vast
complex
tunneled
within
the
mountain
from
the
top
down
to
sea
level
it
even
has
its
own
small
interior
docks
The
way
the
episode
is
shot
doesnt
make
this
explicitly
clear
though
Grey
Worm
climbs
up
interior
passages
in
the
mountain
all
the
way
from
sea
level
to
the
top
Tyrion
previously
mentioned
that
Tywin
put
him
in
charge
of
the
sewer
lines
of
Casterly
Rock
back
in
Season
when
he
remarked
on
it
to
Varys
Tywin
did
it
to
shame
him
but
in
defiance
he
applied
himself
diligently
to
the
task
and
improved
the
sewers
and
cisterns
better
than
they
had
run
in
years
Sneaking
in
through
the
sewer
lines
is
the
same
way
that
Grey
Worm
himself
infiltrated
Meereen
during
its
first
siege
in
Season
Both
Tyrions
work
on
the
sewer
lines
of
Casterly
Rock
and
Daeneryss
forces
using
sewer
lines
to
infiltrate
cities
in
Slavers
Bay
have
happened
in
the
current
novels
this
may
or
may
not
be
foreshadowing
that
Casterly
Rock
will
fall
in
similar
fashion
in
future
novels
Tyrion
statesthat
no
one
has
ever
taken
Casterly
Rock
in
a
siege
This
is
true
though
of
course
Loren
Lannister
surrendered
all
the
Westerlands
to
Aegon
Targaryen
after
the
Field
of
Fire
but
this
was
fought
elsewhere
Even
during
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons
nearby
Lannisport
was
sacked
by
the
ironborn
but
the
gates
of
Casterly
Rock
were
shut
and
they
failed
to
breach
it
It
is
unclear
why
the
Unsullied
dont
try
to
raid
Lannisport
themselves
though
Tyrions
intention
was
to
use
them
as
a
small
and
decisive
force
for
a
precision
strike
against
Casterly
Rock
capturing
or
raiding
even
a
mediumsized
city
like
Lannisport
is
another
matter
and
would
probably
require
a
lot
more
than
Unsullied
Tyrion
states
that
he
converted
a
sewer
line
into
a
secret
passage
to
sneak
prostitutes
in
to
Casterly
Rock
This
isnt
mentioned
in
the
books
but
seems
to
be
a
transposition
of
a
similar
story
point
to
help
Tyrion
meet
Shae
without
being
detected
by
Cerseis
spies
Varys
tells
him
about
a
secret
tunnel
between
Chatayas
brotheland
a
stable
Varys
claims
some
previous
Hand
built
it
to
keep
his
dalliances
with
prostituts
a
secret
Varys
also
reveals
to
Tyrion
several
secret
passages
in
the
Red
Keep
which
he
uses
for
the
same
purpose
One
of
those
passages
leads
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
Tyrion
uses
it
while
escaping
from
prison
to
confront
his
father
Linguist
David
J
Peterson
noted
that
in
the
original
set
of
translations
he
made
for
this
episode
the
line
where
Grey
Worm
shouts
at
a
dying
soldier
Where
are
rest
of
the
Lannisters
was
originally
going
to
be
in
Valyrian
but
was
changed
to
be
EnglishCommon
Tongue
in
the
final
version
which
he
thought
actually
made
more
sense
as
the
dying
Lannister
soldier
wouldnt
understand
the
question
in
Valyrian
The
gold
mines
of
Casterly
Rock
running
dry
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
and
implausible
within
the
books
In
Season
Tywin
explained
that
the
Lannisters
cant
pay
off
their
astronomical
debts
to
the
Iron
Bank
because
all
of
the
gold
mines
in
the
Westerlands
ran
dry
This
is
a
massive
oversimplification
in
the
books
the
Lannisters
simply
spent
gold
on
the
war
faster
than
they
can
mine
it
Just
because
they
sit
on
the
largest
gold
mines
in
Westeros
never
meant
that
they
had
an
infinite
supply
The
gold
mines
of
Casterly
Rock
are
so
rich
that
they
have
entire
grand
halls
lined
with
gold
and
it
is
famous
as
far
away
as
Yi
Ti
their
fantasy
analogue
of
China
Despite
Yi
Tis
own
fabulous
wealth
its
people
eagerly
ask
the
few
travelers
who
reach
there
from
Westeros
about
rumors
theyve
heard
of
a
lionlord
who
lives
in
a
mountain
made
of
gold
In
this
episode
Jaime
says
he
was
willing
to
temporarily
abandon
Casterly
Rock
because
it
doesnt
have
gold
in
it
anymore
Its
possible
that
the
TV
writers
established
that
the
gold
mines
are
running
dry
specifically
to
set
up
these
events
in
Season
Jaime
also
says
that
they
emptied
the
larders
of
Casterly
Rock
right
before
the
Unsullied
came
so
with
winter
upon
them
they
wont
be
able
to
hold
it
anyway
and
will
have
to
abandon
it
It
is
possible
that
if
something
like
this
happens
in
future
books
the
Lannisters
would
remove
all
their
food
stores
and
any
mined
gold
reserves
in
advance
of
their
approach
If
the
Unsullied
cant
hold
the
castle
without
food
stores
causing
them
to
leave
they
also
wouldnt
have
time
to
stay
there
and
mine
new
gold
out
of
the
mountain
in
which
case
it
still
wasnt
necessary
to
say
their
mines
ran
totally
dry
Tyrion
says
that
his
line
about
give
me
ten
good
men
and
Ill
impregnate
the
bitch
is
quoting
someone
else
Bronn
himself
actually
said
this
when
he
and
Tyrion
were
approaching
The
Eyrie
in
The
Vale
of
Arryn
back
in
Season
s
The
Wolf
and
the
Lion
The
Eyrie
is
a
strong
castle
built
atop
a
mountain
with
narrow
approaches
impassable
to
large
armies
and
it
has
never
fallen
to
external
attack
When
Tyrion
remarked
that
the
Eyrie
is
said
to
be
impregnable
Bronns
full
response
was
Give
me
ten
good
men
with
climbing
spikes
and
Ill
impregnate
the
bitch
It
is
unclear
how
Eurons
ironborn
fleet
managed
to
reach
the
west
coast
so
fast
both
Yara
and
Grey
Worm
left
Dragonstone
around
the
same
time
Euron
then
attacked
Yaras
fleet
and
returned
to
Kings
Landing
in
this
episode
to
display
his
captives
to
Cersei
Eurons
fleet
would
then
have
to
outpace
the
Unsullied
fleet
to
reach
Casterly
Rock
On
the
other
hand
it
is
never
shown
that
Euron
himself
accompanied
his
fleet
to
Casterly
Rock
or
if
this
is
a
separate
fleet
also
loyal
to
him
which
sailed
from
the
Iron
Islands
which
are
actually
right
nearby
Casterly
Rock
off
the
west
coast
It
is
unclear
if
it
was
actually
supposed
to
be
his
flagship
Silence
leading
the
attack
but
even
if
it
was
he
isnt
shown
actually
sailing
on
it
Even
if
Euron
only
has
one
large
fleet
and
sent
it
west
while
he
went
to
Kings
Landing
this
is
not
totally
implausible
First
Eurons
fleet
did
arrive
slightly
after
the
Unsullied
did
after
they
already
took
time
landing
and
attacking
Casterly
Rock
they
actually
didnt
outpace
them
but
could
have
been
following
right
behind
Second
the
ironborn
are
indeed
famed
as
having
some
of
the
best
ships
and
sailors
in
the
world
In
contrast
the
Unsullied
fleet
consisted
mostly
of
the
ships
from
the
slaverfleet
they
captured
at
Meereen
being
manned
by
Unsullied
or
freed
slaves
etc
who
are
not
nearly
as
experienced
as
seamen
So
it
is
indeed
within
the
realm
of
possibility
for
Eurons
fleet
to
catch
up
with
the
Unsullied
fleet
if
the
Unsullied
had
a
head
start
of
only
a
few
days
The
question
arises
of
what
exactly
happened
to
the
captive
Edmure
Tully
in
the
TV
continuity
In
the
books
after
the
Second
Siege
of
Riverrun
ended
with
his
surrender
the
Freys
handed
him
over
to
the
Lannisters
who
sent
him
west
to
Casterly
Rock
under
heavy
guard
where
he
would
remain
in
gentle
imprisonment
befitting
a
lord
of
his
station
Roslin
who
is
pregnant
but
has
not
given
birth
yet
will
join
him
soon
In
the
TV
series
Walder
Frey
remarked
in
the
Season
finale
that
they
took
Edmure
back
to
the
dungeons
of
the
Twins
farther
north
If
he
was
still
at
the
Twins
by
the
Season
premiere
his
niece
Arya
Stark
made
no
attempt
to
free
him
its
possible
that
the
Jaimes
Lannister
contingent
simply
took
him
with
them
when
they
left
If
they
did
send
him
ahead
to
Casterly
Rock
it
isnt
a
contradiction
that
the
Unsullied
didnt
free
Edmure
logically
if
Jaime
knew
an
enemy
force
would
take
the
castle
to
the
point
he
intentionally
removed
everything
of
use
emptying
the
larders
etc
if
Edmure
had
been
there
Jaime
would
have
sent
him
somewhere
else
ahead
of
time
ie
to
Kings
Landing
Future
episodes
will
have
to
reveal
Edmures
whereabouts
Its
also
worth
noting
that
some
of
the
interior
sets
of
Casterly
Rock
have
clearly
been
reused
from
Riverruns
set
in
Season
In
the
Reach
Jaimes
comments
about
how
people
will
accept
Cerseis
reign
were
proven
at
the
beginning
of
the
episode
as
the
Smallfolk
cheered
Eurons
victory
Even
though
many
people
despise
Cersei
and
distrust
the
Ironborn
they
want
an
end
to
years
of
war
Highgarden
appears
for
the
first
time
in
this
episode
In
the
books
it
is
built
on
a
much
larger
scale
it
has
three
massive
curtain
walls
and
is
surrounded
by
large
stretches
of
hedge
mazes
and
gardens
Indeed
the
hedge
mazes
also
make
an
approach
difficult
for
any
large
invading
army
they
can
just
cut
a
path
straight
through
but
either
way
theyll
be
slowed
down
When
Jaime
enters
to
confront
her
with
Highgardens
defeat
Olenna
Tyrell
quotes
a
line
from
The
Rains
of
Castamere
the
Lannister
anthem
of
sorts
a
song
about
rushing
their
enemies
House
Reyne
and
now
the
rains
weep
oer
our
halls
It
is
confirmed
that
Jaime
is
carrying
Joffreys
Valyrian
steel
sword
Widows
Wail
referred
to
by
name
in
onscreen
dialogue
Olenna
even
chides
that
because
Joffrey
was
given
it
as
a
wedding
gift
a
matter
of
hours
before
his
death
he
never
actually
wielded
it
In
the
books
Tommen
inherited
the
sword
but
as
he
was
a
minor
he
never
used
it
With
even
Tommen
dead
it
appears
that
it
defaulted
back
to
Jaime
who
can
make
some
use
of
it
Olenna
confirms
that
she
believes
the
truth
of
Jaime
and
Cerseis
incest
which
given
their
behavior
is
hardly
surprising
Ellaria
was
bluntly
aware
of
this
as
well
Previously
she
had
diplomatically
referred
to
them
as
simply
rumors
She
also
directly
refers
to
Joffrey
as
Jaimes
son
when
she
speaks
to
him
Olenna
finally
reveals
the
truth
about
the
Purple
Wedding
to
someone
other
than
Margaery
and
a
Lannister
finally
learns
the
truth
Olenna
also
admits
that
she
didnt
know
it
was
going
to
be
so
gruesome
having
never
seen
the
strangler
in
use
before
and
gives
a
halfhearted
apology
for
that
Interestingly
Olenna
does
not
reveal
to
Jaime
that
Petyr
Baelish
aided
her
in
Joffreys
death
This
may
be
her
playing
the
long
game
even
in
death
she
knows
that
Littlefinger
wants
the
Iron
Throne
and
can
do
far
greater
damage
to
Cersei
if
he
is
left
to
play
his
games
than
if
he
were
to
be
irrevocably
denounced
The
episodes
description
Jaime
learns
from
his
mistakes
refers
to
Jaime
using
the
same
strategy
that
Robb
Stark
used
against
him
at
the
Battle
of
the
Whispering
Wood
at
the
end
of
Season
sacrificing
a
divisionary
force
to
achieve
a
surprise
ambush
in
order
to
take
Highgarden
Robb
send
a
diversionary
force
east
to
the
Battle
of
the
Green
Fork
to
keep
the
Lannister
armies
divided
when
he
real
objective
was
a
surprise
attack
to
the
west
to
lift
the
Lannister
siege
of
Riverrun
led
by
Jaime
the
Whispering
Wood
is
on
the
outskirts
of
Riverrun
The
Battle
of
the
Whispering
Wood
wasnt
referred
to
by
name
during
the
episode
it
took
place
in
because
due
to
budget
constraints
it
happened
offscreen
Stark
soldiers
however
did
refer
to
it
as
Whispering
Wood
in
Season
and
Robb
prominently
said
in
the
Season
premiere
that
his
army
hadnt
had
a
good
fight
since
Whispering
Wood
because
the
Lannisters
were
avoiding
meeting
his
forces
in
a
direct
confrontation
so
they
could
exhaust
him
through
attrition
In
the
books
Jaime
has
indeed
learned
a
valuable
lesson
from
that
battle
but
in
the
opposite
manner
he
does
not
use
Robbs
strategy
against
enemies
instead
he
takes
precautions
sending
scouts
ahead
forbidding
his
men
to
leave
the
column
without
permission
placing
sentries
etc
to
make
certain
he
will
not
be
taken
by
surprise
again
Such
precuations
may
seem
unnecessary
for
at
that
point
the
Starks
have
been
brought
down
so
Jaime
does
not
expect
any
serious
attack
the
Brotherhood
members
hunt
down
only
lone
Freys
and
they
wouldnt
attack
a
large
host
Still
Jaime
insists
on
acting
warily
consistent
with
the
change
he
has
gone
throughout
the
third
novel
once
he
was
rash
and
reckless
and
now
he
is
calculating
and
cautious
It
is
unclear
if
Highgarden
will
actually
fall
like
this
in
future
novels
It
does
seem
to
match
the
strategy
of
feinting
towards
one
objective
but
then
truly
striking
at
another
which
several
characters
use
Specifically
Euron
Greyjoy
himself
in
the
books
makes
a
feint
towards
Highgarden
which
is
in
the
north
of
the
Reach
when
he
attacks
the
Shield
Islands
which
guard
the
mouth
of
the
Mander
River
which
ironborn
longships
can
sail
up
to
attack
Highgarden
but
later
admits
that
this
was
to
trick
the
Tyrells
into
concentrating
all
of
their
armies
in
the
north
when
his
true
objective
was
to
attack
Oldtown
itself
secondlargest
city
in
Westeros
which
is
in
the
south
of
the
Reach
It
is
odd
that
the
Sack
of
Highgarden
proceeded
so
quickly
given
that
Highgarden
is
actually
a
rather
defensible
castle
with
three
enormous
certain
walls
Even
the
gardens
are
deadly
as
invading
infantry
would
need
to
navigate
the
castles
complex
hedge
maze
immediately
inside
the
outer
wall
Of
course
Jaime
didnt
mention
how
many
men
he
and
Tarly
lost
so
its
possible
that
the
soldiers
and
castle
gave
as
good
as
they
got
It
seems
somewhat
implied
that
the
main
Tyrell
army
was
in
the
east
advancing
on
Kings
Landing
so
Highgarden
itself
was
caught
lightly
defended
A
direct
comparison
is
the
Siege
of
Casterly
Rock
in
this
same
episode
the
welldefended
castle
is
taken
after
the
elite
attacking
force
suffers
numerous
causalities
from
arrows
and
close
combat
even
from
a
token
garrison
left
behind
while
the
main
Lannister
army
left
due
to
the
defensive
advantage
of
such
a
strong
castle
Indeed
in
the
case
of
Casterly
Rock
the
Unsullied
took
a
few
casualties
but
managed
to
quickly
take
the
castle
due
to
Tyrions
plan
to
infiltrate
it
using
his
knowledge
of
the
sewer
line
The
LannisterTarly
force
would
have
no
such
advantage
against
Highgarden
even
if
it
only
had
a
token
defense
Seemingly
presenting
that
all
three
of
Daeneryss
major
allies
from
Westeros
itself
have
been
removed
by
the
end
of
this
episode
raises
several
major
plot
issues
a
decapitation
strike
against
these
leaders
she
allied
with
wouldnt
remove
their
followers
and
armies
The
TV
showrunners
may
simply
be
attempting
to
quickly
rush
over
the
details
of
Daeneryss
invasion
without
explaining
these
major
plot
points
Yara
was
captured
and
her
fleet
was
devastated
She
didnt
control
territory
and
her
followers
did
suffer
a
direct
assault
so
there
is
no
issue
here
As
for
Dorne
however
while
Ellaria
was
captured
and
her
daughters
killed
it
was
explicitly
stated
that
they
were
sailing
south
to
Sunspear
to
ferry
the
Dornish
army
back
to
Dragonstone
that
is
the
Dornish
army
wasnt
destroyed
while
on
Yaras
fleet
because
they
hadnt
even
picked
them
up
yet
This
leaves
totally
unanswered
the
question
of
what
the
Dornish
armies
will
do
full
strength
armies
that
havent
even
been
blooded
in
the
years
of
war
Surely
someone
must
be
ruling
Dorne
now
perhaps
Elia
Sand
or
some
mention
would
have
to
be
made
that
it
has
fallen
into
chaos
and
infighting
The
TV
writers
however
might
simply
be
unconcerned
with
these
remaining
plot
threads
again
stating
that
if
the
Nymeria
Sand
actress
couldnt
return
for
Season
they
wouldnt
even
bother
to
recast
the
actress
or
explain
what
happened
to
the
character
Comparable
to
Ellaria
it
is
unknown
if
this
is
being
presented
as
a
decapitation
strike
against
Olenna
at
Highgarden
while
it
is
defended
only
by
its
own
home
garrison
or
if
the
TV
show
is
presenting
that
the
halfstrength
Lannister
army
numbering
maybe
men
plus
the
Tarlys
managed
to
defeat
the
entire
army
of
the
Reach
the
Tyrells
and
their
allies
which
was
twice
as
large
as
the
Lannister
army
before
it
got
bloodied
in
the
war
albeit
some
Reach
lords
like
the
Tarlys
switched
sides
The
Lannisters
didnt
take
Oldtown
for
example
and
its
rulers
House
Hightower
are
staunch
allies
of
the
Tyrells
Margaery
and
Loras
were
both
halfHightower
through
their
mother
Alerie
Hightower
or
Olennas
own
family
House
Redwyne
of
The
Arbor
etc
So
far
at
least
the
TV
series
has
glossed
over
the
fall
of
the
Reach
without
explaining
these
plot
issues
It
has
been
unclear
since
the
Destruction
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
what
the
line
of
succession
for
House
Tyrell
was
even
if
Maces
entire
bloodline
or
even
Olennas
entire
bloodline
was
wiped
out
if
other
unnamed
Tyrell
cousins
came
for
the
trial
the
Tyrells
are
a
large
and
wealthy
family
with
numerous
minor
cousins
spread
across
Westeros
who
wouldnt
have
all
gathered
for
it
and
thus
would
have
survived
A
possible
answer
to
the
situation
now
might
be
the
tacit
assumption
that
any
surviving
Tyrells
retreated
to
Highgarden
and
now
died
in
its
defense
That
is
as
a
simplification
for
the
TV
continuity
it
is
at
least
plausible
to
say
that
the
Tyrells
are
extinct
in
contrast
with
the
Martells
of
which
it
was
mentioned
that
there
are
five
other
Sand
Snakes
who
never
even
left
Dorne
and
should
thus
still
be
alive

showrunners
David
Benioff
and
DB
Weiss
gave
their
explanation
for
why
the
Lannisters
were
able
to
capture
Higharden
and
why
they
didnt
show
it
on
camera

Benioff
The
TyrellsFighting
isnt
really
their
forte
I
mean
theyre
just
not
known
for
being
the
most
fearsome
warriors
so
to
have
a
long
extended
battle
there
didnt
make
a
lot
of
sense
Weiss
We
decided
to
cut
to
the
chase
and
cut
right
to
Jaime
singlemindedly
making
his
way
to
the
person
hes
there
to
see
which
is
Olenna
Tyrell
Loras
Tyrell
one
of
the
very
top
tournament
knights
in
all
of
Westeros
Loras
Tyrell
wearing
Renlys
armor
leads
the
Tyrell
cavalry
to
crush
Stanniss
army
and
save
the
Lannisters
are
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
Loras
standing
next
to
Tywin
after
their
victory
at
the
Blackwater
after
the
formidable
warriors
of
House
Tyrell
turned
back
Stanniss
assault
Benioff
and
Weisss
comments
about
the
Tyrells
martial
abilities
are
problematic
in
several
regards
the
Tyrells
in
fact
do
have
a
reputation
as
formidable
warriors
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
both
the
Tyrell
family
members
and
all
of
their
retainers
and
armies
in
general
The
Reach
is
the
heartland
of
chivalry
in
Westeros
with
some
of
the
most
famous
knights
Loras
Tyrell
specifically
was
one
of
the
most
skilled
knights
in
the
entire
continent
even
Jaime
listed
him
as
one
of
the
few
men
who
ever
beat
him
in
personal
combat
Littlefinger
even
lost
a
Valyrian
steel
dagger
in
a
wager
on
a
tournament
joust
between
Loras
and
Jaime
right
before
the
story
begins
because
he
bet
on
Jaime
and
was
surprised
when
Loras
managed
to
beat
him
Loras
even
managed
to
defeat
Gregor
Clegane
in
the
tournament
during
Season
albeit
by
using
underhanded
tactics
outthinking
Gregor
by
using
a
mare
in
heat
to
distract
his
stallion
At
the
time
Ned
Stark
even
assured
Sansa
that
Loras
rides
well
and
was
one
of
the
few
knights
in
Westeros
who
could
plausibly
challenge
the
monstrous
Gregor
The
Tyrell
army
was
the
decisive
force
whose
aid
helped
Tywin
achieve
victory
at
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
again
with
Loras
leading
their
cavalry
charge
The
Tyrell
army
containing
numerous
knights
as
heavy
cavalry
was
twice
as
large
as
the
Lannister
army
when
the
war
began
and
didnt
get
nearly
as
bloodied
as
the
Lannister
armies
did
from
attrition
by
this
point
Tywin
himself
considered
them
such
vital
allies
that
he
arranged
a
double
marriagealliance
to
keep
them
in
the
fold
Joffrey
to
Margaery
and
Cersei
to
Loras
to
Lorass
brother
in
the
book
version
The
TV
series
never
had
a
specific
moment
when
it
somehow
established
that
the
Tyrells
are
not
formidable
warriors
or
that
their
army
as
a
whole
is
formidable
It
increasingly
appears
that
the
only
basis
Benioff
could
have
had
for
this
comment
that
the
Tyrells
do
not
have
a
reputation
as
formidable
warriors
is
due
to
some
stereotype
about
Loras
Tyrell
being
homosexual
therefore
effeminate
and
not
formidable
in
combat
Even
this
doesnt
make
much
sense
given
that
Loras
is
dead
at
this
point
in
the
story
so
whoever
is
the
castellan
in
charge
of
Highgardens
defenses
now
isnt
even
an
introduced
character
Loras
actually
did
have
significantly
more
moments
in
the
novels
which
established
his
presence
as
a
formidable
warrior
with
fighting
as
his
forte
though
even
the
TV
series
introduced
his
earned
reputation
and
abilities
in
prior
seasons
This
brings
up
the
separate
issue
from
the
Season
premiere
of
the
Abandonment
of
Dragonstone
the
TV
series
said
that
Stannis
simply
abandoned
the
castle
when
he
left
and
during
the
intervening
three
years
no
one
else
attempted
to
claim
it
this
never
happens
to
any
castle
in
the
history
of
Westeros
In
the
books
Stannis
left
a
small
token
garrison
behind
who
nonetheless
could
have
held
out
for
months
due
to
the
strength
of
the
castle
so
the
Lannister
and
Tyrell
fleets
were
forced
to
blockade
the
island
With
the
rise
of
Eurons
ironborn
to
the
west
the
Tyrell
fleet
urgently
needed
to
return
home
so
Loras
volunteered
to
forced
a
quick
end
to
the
siege
by
storming
the
castle
at
great
personal
risk
to
himself
All
who
saw
Loras
fight
were
awed
by
his
skill
and
bravery
carving
his
way
through
waves
of
foes
despite
taking
numerous
severe
wounds
that
he
shrugged
off
until
boiling
oil
was
dropped
on
him
from
a
tower
The
TV
series
cut
this
out
entirely
thus
Benioff
claims
that
the
Tyrells
are
not
established
as
formidable
warriors
in
part
because
the
showrunners
omitted
a
major
scene
from
the
novels
which
establishes
Loras
as
a
formidable
warrior
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
is
homosexual
Even
removing
the
Dragonstone
subplot
prior
seasons
nonetheless
already
established
that
Loras
was
one
of
the
top
knights
in
all
of
Westeros
In
the
books
This
section
will
be
updated
with
comparisons
after
the
sixth
novel
is
released
The
episode
contains
influences
from
the
following
chapter
ofA
Storm
of
Swords
Chapter
Tyrion
XI
Someone
calls
Jaime
a
fool
for
him
blindly
following
Cersei
and
not
seeing
through
her
deeds
and
claims
to
be
Joffreys
murderer
The
episode
contains
influences
from
the
following
chapters
ofA
Feast
for
Crows
Chapter
Cersei
V
Cersei
speaks
with
an
envoy
of
the
Iron
Bank
Chapter
Jaime
III
Jaime
states
that
he
has
learned
a
lesson
from
the
battle
of
the
Whispering
Wood
The
episode
contains
influences
from
the
following
chapter
of
A
Dance
with
Dragons
Chapter
Daenerys
III
In
Meereen
Daenerys
Targaryen
is
visited
by
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
as
an
envoy
of
Qarth
He
explains
that
Daeneryss
disruption
of
the
slave
trade
has
had
severe
economic
ripple
effects
across
Essos
from
Qarth
to
Volantis
as
Slavers
Bay
is
the
main
exporter
of
slaves
across
the
entire
continent
Cerseis
argument
to
Tycho
in
the
TV
series
that
Daeneryss
disruption
of
the
slave
trade
has
disrupted
investments
of
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
as
well
might
take
some
loose
inspiration
from
this
Chapter
Tyrion
VI
Someone
complains
that
the
disruption
of
slave
trade
by
Daenerys
has
negative
applications
on
worldwide
economy
Chapter
Jon
IX
Tycho
Nestoris
from
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
meets
with
someone
and
explains
rumors
he
has
heard
of
dragonsin
the
east
The
person
makes
light
of
this
rumor
but
Tycho
warns
that
the
Braavosi
are
descended
from
slaves
who
fled
the
dragonlords
of
Valyria
so
he
wouldnt
joke
about
this
and
actually
seems
somewhat
wary
of
Daenerys
The
episode
contains
influences
from
the
following
chapter
of
The
Winds
of
Winter
The
Forsaken
Euron
Greyjoy
feints
towards
Highgarden
in
the
north
of
the
Reach
to
lure
the
Tyrell
armies
away
from
his
real
objective
Oldtown
in
the
south
of
the
Reach

TV
version

switched

Game
of
Thrones
title
card
The
title
sequence
consists
of
a
threedimensional
map
of
the
world
with
the
continents
of
Westeros
and
Essos
located
on
the
inner
surface
of
a
sphere
At
the
center
of
the
sphere
is
a
light
source
effectively
a
sun
surrounded
by
an
astrolabelike
arrangement
of
rotating
rings
The
details
of
the
title
sequence
change
each
week
depending
on
the
locations
visited
The
following
description
is
how
the
sequence
appears
in
the
first
episode
of
the
series
Winter
is
Coming
The
sequence
opens
with
a
closeup
of
the
sun
and
the
astrolabe
surrounding
it
Relief
details
are
visible
on
the
astrolabe
showing
a
volcano
destroying
a
city
while
a
dragon
watches
on
and
several
people
escaping
in
a
boat
a
reference
to
the
Doom
of
Valyriaand
the
Targaryens
escape
from
it
The
camera
then
pans
to
a
wideshot
of
Westeros
and
Essos
before
zooming
in
on
the
city
of
Kings
Landing
in
particular
the
sigil
of
House
Baratheon
on
what
appears
to
be
a
large
gear
in
the
middle
of
the
city
The
gear
begins
turning
moving
other
cogs
and
then
threedimensional
buildings
start
rising
out
of
the
ground
such
as
the
Red
Keep
and
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
Once
the
city
is
assembled
the
camera
moves
north
across
Westeros
to
Winterfell
which
similarly
rises
out
of
the
ground
while
a
gear
bearing
the
sigil
of
House
Stark
rotates
The
camera
pays
particular
attention
to
the
godswood
of
Winterfell
and
its
heart
tree
as
it
rises
out
of
the
ground
before
panning
up
to
the
sun
and
astrolabe
There
is
then
another
closeup
of
the
detail
on
the
astrolabe
this
time
showing
the
Stark
direwolf
Lannister
lion
and
Baratheon
stag
engaging
the
Targaryen
dragon
in
combat
a
reference
to
Roberts
Rebellion
The
camera
returns
to
Winterfell
and
then
pans
north
to
the
Wall
where
more
gears
start
turning
and
Castle
Black
emerges
from
the
ground
while
the
pulley
lift
emerges
from
the
face
of
the
Wall
The
camera
pulls
all
the
way
back
to
Kings
Landing
before
moving
across
the
Narrow
Seato
the
Free
City
of
Pentos
which
similarly
emerges
from
the
ground
while
gears
rotate
The
title
sequence
ends
with
a
return
to
the
relief
detail
of
the
astrolabe
now
showing
the
animals
representing
the
various
noble
houses
of
Westeros
bowing
to
the
triumphant
Baratheon
stag
The
Game

Thrones
logo
then
appears
over
the
astrolabe
with
the
heads
of
a
dragon
wolf
lion
and
stag
emerging
from
the
side
of
the
logo
Throughout
the
series
the
title
sequence
continues
to
change
and
add
locations
depending
on
the
locations
visited
in
that
particular
episode
In
the
first
season
Vaes
Dothrak
The
Eyrie
and
the
Twins
appeared
Dragonstone
Pyke
Harrenhal
and
Qarth
first
appeared
in
the
second
season
Astapor
Riverrun
and
Yunkai
first
appeared
in
the
third
season
The
Dreadfort
Meereen
Braavos
and
Moat
Cailin
first
appeared
in
the
fourth
season
while
the
region
of
Dorne
was
the
only
location
added
during
the
fifth
season
No
new
locations
were
added
to
the
title
sequence
during
the
sixth
season
Oldtownand
Eastwatchfirst
appeared
in
the
seventh
season
Conception
The
title
sequence
was
created
by
Elastic
the
company
that
previously
created
the
title
sequences
for
Rome
Big
Love
and
Carnivale
for
HBO
The
latter
won
them
an
Emmy
Award
The
title
sequence
was
inspired
by
the
maps
of
Westeros
that
precede
each
novel
in
the
series
and
maps
in
fantasy
novels
in
general
The
creators
decided
to
place
the
map
on
the
inner
surface
of
a
sphere
with
an
astrolabesun
object
at
the
center
The
camera
would
then
visit
different
parts
of
the
map
while
illustrations
on
the
astrolabe
covered
some
of
the
backstory
to
the
series
The
turning
gears
and
cogs
were
meant
to
be
reminiscent
of
Leonardo
da
Vincis
inventions
As
for
why
it
is
specifically
an
astrolabe
with
moving
parts
producer
Greg
Spence
explained
that
Angus
Wall
at
Elastic
came
up
with
a
vision
of
a
mad
monk
in
a
tower
somewhere
who
was
somehow
keeping
track
of
all
this
action
and
creating
as
he
went
He
would
then
fashion
little
automatons
out
of
the
materials
that
would
be
available
in
his
world
They
would
be
stone
or
tin
or
wood
and
everything
would
feel
very
handcrafted
Rules
In
an
interview
during
Season
producer
Greg
Spence
explained
several
rules
about
which
locations
appear
in
each
episodes
opening
sequence
These
rules
explain
why
the
map
doesnt
always
match
up
exactly
to
what
appears
in
the
episode
First
as
a
rule
every
episodes
map
must
contain
Kings
Landing
Winterfell
The
Wall
and
wherever
Daenerys
is
at
the
moment
even
if
Daenerys
does
not
appear
in
that
episode
The
reason
for
this
rule
about
Daenerys
is
because
her
locations
outside
of
Westeros
help
show
the
vast
sweep
of
the
entire
world
which
is
larger
than
just
the
one
continent
Westeros
If
the
camera
simply
panned
up
from
Kings
Landing
to
Winterfell
and
then
the
Wall
it
wouldnt
really
show
much
of
the
world
at
all
As
Spence
said
The
way
the
main
title
and
the
way
that
the
camera
travels
and
crossing
the
Narrow
Sea
into
Essos
is
important
to
us
because
it
communicates
the
expanse
of
the
show
and
it
helps
to
remind
the
audience
of
the
entire
world
in
which
the
show
takes
place
I
think
if
we
tried
to
limit
the
main
title
to
just
places
that
appear
in
the
episodes
or
were
literally
tracing
each
character
it
would
be
more
confusing
and
less
successful
at
its
primary
task
which
is
really
orienting
people
to
the
world
Winterfell
also
appears
in
every
episode
even
though
during
seasons
and
it
was
never
physically
visited
Again
this
is
to
ground
the
most
important
parts
of
the
world
within
the
narrative
Kings
Landing
is
the
capital
city
the
Wall
is
meant
to
hold
back
the
return
of
the
White
Walkers
and
Winterfell
is
the
home
of
all
the
Starks
Second
they
dont
always
have
the
time
and
resources
to
create
specific
animations
for
every
minor
location
thus
the
capital
of
a
region
is
often
used
as
a
standin
to
represent
the
overall
territory
For
example
at
the
beginning
of
Season
the
Eyrie
appears
in
the
title
sequence
even
though
Sansa
and
Littlefinger
left
it
at
the
end
of
Season
Instead
they
are
at
Runestone
a
major
castle
in
the
Vale
Even
so
Spence
explained
they
didnt
make
a
separate
animation
for
Runestone
because
it
would
only
appear
in
that
one
episode
and
wasnt
that
important
to
the
storyline
as
a
whole
so
it
didnt
justify
the
time
and
expense
in
creating
an
entirely
new
animation
Therefore
the
Eyrie
appears
in
that
title
sequence
to
represent
the
Vale
as
a
whole
because
it
is
the
capital
These
budget
constraints
are
also
why
they
havent
made
animations
for
many
important
locations
which
only
appear
once
or
twice
they
have
to
skew
their
choices
towards
locations
which
they
know
are
going
to
reappear
more
than
once
so
the
money
invested
in
producing
each
animation
will
get
as
much
use
as
possible
Pentos
only
appeared
once
in
the
first
four
seasons
and
through
Season
has
been
the
rarest
location
but
it
appeared
in
the
first
episode
due
to
the
rule
that
they
need
to
show
where
Daenerys
is
Third
and
perhaps
most
importantly
they
can
only
show
a
limited
number
of
locations
in
the
second
duration
of
the
opening
sequence
The
title
sequence
is
never
going
to
be
delayed
longer
in
part
due
to
the
finite
length
of
the
opening
theme
song
As
additional
locations
appear
some
of
the
animations
are
being
sped
up
to
fit
into
the
desired
duration
most
notably
in
later
versions
of
the
title
sequence
usually
only
the
last
one
from
the
original
three
takes
of
the
Wall
animation
is
being
used
Added
to
this
is
the
time
it
takes
for
the
camera
to
zoom
in
and
out
and
pan
across
the
globe
which
can
vary
depending
on
which
locations
are
in
a
single
episode
The
combined
result
is
that
through
Season
no
opening
sequence
has
ever
contained
more
than
six
locations
because
there
physically
isnt
enough
time
to
fit
more
in
they
might
have
more
than
six
at
a
later
point
if
two
are
close
together
This
became
particularly
notable
in
Season
up
to
that
point
Daenerys
and
her
associated
storyline
was
the
only
major
character
not
in
Westeros
barring
Stanniss
oneepisode
trip
to
Braavos
in
Season
Starting
in
Season
however
other
characters
start
traveling
to
the
eastern
continent
particularly
Arya
Stark
Tyrion
Lannister
and
Varys
Meanwhile
the
TV
series
also
physically
visited
Dorne
for
the
first
time
at
the
extreme
southern
end
of
Westeros
meaning
it
would
take
even
longer
for
the
camera
to
pan
down
to
it
Also
consider
that
each
title
sequence
as
a
rule
must
show
the
Wall
which
is
on
the
exact
opposite
lengthwise
side
of
the
entire
continent
For
example
in
episode
besides
the
four
constant
locations
Kings
Landing
Winterfell
the
Wall
and
Daenerys
in
Meereen
the
other
major
locations
were
Arya
in
Braavos
Tyrion
in
the
outskirts
of
Pentos
the
Eyrie
for
Sansa
in
the
Vale
and
the
introduction
of
Dorne
This
amounted
to
eight
locations
and
all
at
the
far
corners
of
the
map
so
there
just
wasnt
enough
time
to
zoom
to
each
of
them
Thus
the
new
Dorne
animation
could
not
debut
in
this
episode
and
the
Pentos
animation
didnt
reappear
either
Greg
Spence
explained
that
they
simply
have
to
weigh
how
many
motions
the
camera
can
physically
make
in
a
limited
amount
of
time
and
make
tradeoffs
relative
to
how
important
a
location
is
in
a
given
episode
Similarly
in
episode
in
addition
to
the
core
four
locations
both
Sansa
and
Brienne
went
to
Moat
Cailin
Arya
was
in
Braavos
and
Tyrion
arrived
at
Volantis
While
Volantis
is
an
important
location
within
the
narrative
and
characters
have
discussed
it
throughout
the
TV
series
it
was
the
first
time
it
had
been
physically
visted
and
they
didnt
know
at
the
time
if
it
would
be
revisited
meaning
it
didnt
justify
the
expense
of
creating
an
entirely
new
Volantisanimation
that
would
only
get
used
once
It
also
would
have
involved
a
large
amount
of
panning
by
the
camera
because
Braavos
is
the
northernmost
Free
City
and
Volantis
is
the
southernmost

Renly
Baratheonsrc
House
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock
is
one
of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros
one
of
its
richest
and
most
powerful
families
and
oldest
dynasties
It
is
also
the
current
royal
house
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
following
the
extinction
of
House
Baratheon
of
Kings
Landing
which
had
been
their
puppet
house
anyway
The
Lannisters
rule
over
the
Westerlands
Their
seat
is
Casterly
Rock
a
massive
rocky
promontory
overlooking
the
Sunset
Sea
which
has
had
habitations
and
fortifications
built
into
it
over
the
millennia
They
are
the
Lords
Paramount
of
the
Westerlands
and
Wardens
of
the
West
As
the
new
royal
house
they
also
rule
directly
over
the
Crownlands
from
their
seat
of
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
the
traditional
seat
of
the
royal
family
House
Lannisters
Heraldry
consists
of
a
golden
lion
on
a
crimson
background
and
their
House
words
are
Hear
me
roar
which
is
rarely
mentioned
Their
unofficial
motto
which
is
as
well
known
as
the
official
one
is
A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts
which
is
used
much
more
often
and
mostly
in
negative
context
though
it
can
also
be
used
in
the
original
literal
sense
The
incestuous
relationship
of
Cersei
and
Jaime
has
been
concealed
in
a
conspiracy
Their
son
Joffrey
Baratheon
has
claimed
the
Iron
Throne
on
the
premise
that
he
was
actually
fathered
by
the
late
King
Robert
Baratheon
Lord
Tywin
was
a
key
supporter
of
his

History
Background
House
Lannister
is
one
of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros
Their
lands
are
in
the
far
west
of
the
continent
Their
seat
is
Casterly
Rock
a
castle
on
a
rocky
promontory
overlooking
the
Sunset
Sea
It
overlooks
the
thriving
city
of
Lannisport
and
sits
atop
the
most
productive
gold
mine
in
the
Westerlands
They
are
the
wealthiest
family
in
the
realm
They
once
possessed
a
Valyrian
steel
sword
called
Brightroar
which
was
lost
by
King
Tommen
II
Lannister
The
red
lion
of
Reyne
confronts
the
golden
lion
of
Lannister
Fairhaired
tall
and
handsome
the
modern
Lannisters
are
the
blood
of
Andal
adventurers
who
carved
out
a
mighty
kingdom
in
the
western
hills
and
valleys
Through
the
female
line
they
boast
of
descent
from
Lann
the
Clever
the
legendary
trickster
of
the
Age
of
Heroes
who
swindled
Casterly
Rock
from
its
previous
rulers
They
used
to
rule
the
Westerlands
as
the
Kings
of
the
Rock
before
swearing
allegiance
to
the
Targaryen
family
The
last
King
of
the
Rock
Loren
Lannister
and
the
last
King
of
the
Reach
Mern
Gardener
joined
forces
and
fielded
men
against
Aegon
the
Conqueror
They
were
defeated
by
his
dragons
in
a
battle
that
came
to
be
known
as
the
Field
of
Fire
and
lost
men
They
have
since
served
the
Targaryens
and
now
King
Robert
Baratheon
as
the
Lords
Paramount
of
the
Westerlands
and
Wardens
of
the
West
The
gold
of
Casterly
Rock
and
the
Golden
Tooth
has
made
them
the
wealthiest
of
the
Great
Houses
Tywin
Lannister
is
the
current
head
of
the
family
His
father
Tytos
Lannister
presided
over
a
period
of
decline
for
the
house
He
frittered
away
much
of
their
fortune
on
poor
investments
and
allowed
himself
to
be
mocked
at
court
creating
a
perception
of
weakness
Their
vassals
House
Reyne
of
Castamere
rebelled
against
Lord
Tytos
Tywin
put
down
the
rebellion
personally
extinguishing
their
house
and
reestablishing
the
fearsome
reputation
of
House
Lannister
His
ruthlessness
gave
darker
meaning
to
the
common
phrase
A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts
and
was
immortalized
in
the
song
The
Rains
of
Castamere
Tywin
has
three
children
Cersei
Jaime
and
Tyrion
by
his
wife
Joanna
Lannister
Joanna
died
after
giving
birth
to
Tyrion
Tyrion
is
a
dwarf
and
has
a
troubled
relationship
with
Tywin
Cersei
and
Jaime
are
fraternal
twins
Cersei
is
Queen
of
Westeros
since
Tywin
arranged
for
her
marriage
to
King
Robert
Baratheon
in
exchange
for
his
support
in
Roberts
Rebellion
She
has
a
longstanding
incestuous
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
The
two
conspire
to
conceal
their
love
and
have
passed
their
children
Joffrey
Myrcella
and
Tommen
off
as
being
the
product
of
Cerseis
marriage

continues
to
believe

later
walk
out
onto
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept
where
they
wave
to
a
crowd
of
smallfolk
much
to
Cerseis
worry
She
meets
with
her
father
and
asks
if
they
are
doing
everything
in
their
power
to
get
Jaime
back
She
then
warns
him
about
Margaery
and
the
Tyrells
but
Tywin
retorts
that
he
distrusts
Cersei
not
because
she
is
a
woman
but
because
she
is
not
nearly
as
clever
as
she
thinks
she
is
He
proclaims
that
he
will
tame
Joffrey
where
Cersei
has
failed
and
Margaery
has
succeeded
At
Riverrun
Martyn
Lannister
and
Willem
Lannister
who
were
taken
hostage
by
Tully
forces
during
the
Battle
of
Stone
Mill
are
murdered
by
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
as
revenge
for
the
deaths
of
his
sons
one
of
which
was
at
the
hands
of
the
Kingslayer
As
a
result
Robb
Stark
beheads
Lord
Rickard
against
the
counsel
of
his
advisors
Edmure
Tully
warns
his
nephew
that
word
of
their
deaths
cannot
leave
Riverrun
or
the
Lannisters
may
seek
revenge
After
meeting
with
Olenna
Tyrell
who
agrees
to
have
House
Tyrell
pay
for
half
the
expenses
of
the
royal
wedding
Tyrion
meets
with
his
father
and
sister
at
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
where
Tywin
had
moved
the
small
council
meetings
too
There
he
reveals
that
he
has
discovered
through
Littlefinger
and
his
spy
Olyvar
that
the
Tyrells
are
plotting
to
marry
Sansa
Stark
to
Loras
Tyrell
In
order
to
stop
this
Tywin
arranges
for
the
marriage
of
Tyrion
to
Sansa
and
Cersei
to
Loras
Neither
of
the
Lannister
children
are
happy
about
this
and
try
to
argue
back
against
it
enraging
Tywin
Tywin
later
meets
with
Olenna
to
gain
her
approval
stating
that
if
she
doesnt
approve
he
will
name
Loras
to
the
Kingsguard
thus
removing
the
sole
heir
of
the
Tyrell
main
branch
from
the
line
of
succession
given
that
Loras
is
the
only
son
of
Mace
Tyrell
Tyrion
and
Cersei
watch
as
Sansa
and
Loras
discuss
their
wedding
As
they
wonder
who
has
received
the
worst
end
of
the
arrangements
Tyrion
asks
Cersei
if
she
was
the
one
to
order
Ser
Mandon
Moore
to
kill
him
during
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
but
discovers
it
was
in
fact
Joffrey
not
his
sister
as
he
previously
believed
He
notes
how
impulsive
and
reckless
the
act
was
given
that
it
was
in
public
and
live
view
of
his
own
men
The
two
then
hope
for
Jaimes
return
Afterwards
Tyrion
meets
with
Sansa
and
Shae
in
the
formers
chambers
where
he
awkwardly
informs
the
two
of
the
recent
marital
arrangements
made
by
Tywin
Meanwhile
in
the
Riverlands
Jaime
and
Brienne
are
brought
to
Lord
Roose
Bolton
at
Harrenhal
by
Locke
Roose
apologizes
for
the
way
his
soldiers
treated
them
but
isnt
short
of
playing
a
mind
game
with
Jaime
leading
him
on
to
believe
that
Stannis
took
Kings
Landing
at
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
and
killed
his
sister
until
he
reveals
the
truth
He
then
has
Jaime
taken
to
former
maester
Qyburn
the
only
survivor
of
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
after
he
had
the
castle
put
to
the
sword
when
he
and
his
garrison
abandoned
it
Qyburn
washes
out
Jaimes
wound
who
refuses
Milk
of
the
Poppy
leaving
him
agonizing
in
pain
Jaime
then
meets
with
Brienne
in
a
bathtub
that
he
decides
to
share
with
her
At
first
he
insults
Brienne
for
failing
to
keep
him
in
one
piece
comparing
it
to
how
she
failed
to
protect
Renly
Baratheon
but
he
quickly
apologizes
for
being
rude
and
asks
for
a
truce
stating
that
he
trusts
her
He
then
tells
her
the
story
of
how
he
became
the
Kingslayer
after
she
continues
to
glare
at
him
reminding
him
of
the
stares
he
has
been
given
since
the
Sack
of
Kings
Landing
during
Roberts
Rebellion
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
had
caches
of
wildfire
placed
beneath
Kings
Landing
and
when
Tywin
arrived
and
tricked
Aerys
into
opening
the
city
gates
but
instead
proceeded
to
sack
the
city
in
Roberts
name
Aerys
ordered
Jaime
to
bring
him
his
fathers
head
and
commanded
his
pyromancers
Wisdom
Rossart
among
them
to
burn
them
all
Jaime
first
killed
the
pyromancers
and
then
Aerys
when
he
had
turned
to
flee
It
was
there
that
Eddard
Stark
had
found
Jaime
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Aeryss
corpse
beneath
it
Jaime
overwhelmed
by
the
memories
falls
over
and
nearly
faints
in
the
bathtub
but
is
recovered
by
Brienne
Jaime
and
Brienne
dine
with
Roose
Bolton
who
says
that
he
will
return
Jaime
to
Kings
Landing
because
of
the
abuses
he
endured
from
his
men
but
that
Brienne
will
not
accompany
them
due
to
her
treason
As
he
is
about
to
leave
Jaime
meets
with
Brienne
one
last
time
the
latter
of
which
addresses
him
as
Ser
Jaime
Brienne
asks
that
Jaime
remember
his
vows
to
return
Catelyns
daughters
Sansa
and
Arya
Stark
home
to
her
to
which
Jaime
says
that
he
will
He
then
departs
from
Harrenhal
with
Bolton
soldiers
to
protect
them
as
well
as
Qyburn
Before
leaving
Jaime
asks
Roose
Bolton
to
send
the
Lannisters
regards
at
Edmure
Tullys
wedding
to
a
Frey
girl
one
of
Walder
Freys
daughters
However
on
the
journey
back
Qyburn
tells
Jaime
that
Locke
believes
he
is
being
cheated
by
Selwyn
Tarth
given
that
he
has
not
offered
sapphires
for
his
daughters
safe
return
and
says
that
Locke
and
the
Boltons
will
likely
hurt
Brienne
prompting
Jaime
to
force
his
protectors
to
return
him
to
Harrenhal
There
he
finds
Brienne
in
a
fighting
pit
with
Lockes
bear
He
jumps
down
to
protect
her
Steelshanks
shoots
arrows
into
the
bear
while
Bolton
men
bring
the
two
out
of
the
pit
Jaime
then
declares
that
he
will
be
leaving
with
Brienne
and
the
two
depart
from
Harrenhal
but
not
before
apologizing
to
Locke
about
the
sapphires
Tyrion
and
Bronn
discuss
his
marriage
to
Sansa
with
Tyrion
not
looking
forward
to
the
wedding
due
to
her
being
a
child
Meanwhile
Tywin
meets
with
his
grandson
after
being
summoned
to
the
throne
room
in
the
Red
Keep
Joffrey
asks
for
a
report
on
the
small
council
meetings
that
he
has
missed
which
Tywin
responds
that
he
is
welcome
to
begin
attending
them
Joffrey
complains
how
he
hasnt
been
counseled
but
Tywin
replies
that
he
is
being
counseled
now
When
Joffrey
asks
about
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
her
three
dragons
Tywin
remarks
how
the
Targaryen
dragon
skulls
were
kept
in
the
throne
room
during
their
reign
the
last
of
which
was
the
size
of
an
apple
He
states
that
Daenerys
is
the
least
of
their
concern
being
nothing
more
than
a
curiosity
in
Essos
but
Joffrey
continues
to
remain
worried
over
her
growing
power
It
is
the
day
of
the
wedding
of
Tyrion
and
Sansa
Stark
During
the
ceremony
Joffrey
cruelly
and
mockingly
takes
away
the
chair
Tyrion
was
to
use
to
cloak
Sansa
and
bring
her
under
his
protection
forcing
her
to
kneel
During
the
feast
he
continues
to
berate
the
two
threatening
to
rape
Sansa
and
forcing
the
newly
wed
couple
to
partake
in
a
bedding
ceremony
but
Tyrion
who
is
quite
drunk
much
to
the
disapproval
of
his
father
threatens
Joffrey
Tywin
and
Tyrion
cool
down
the
situation
and
he
walks
away
with
Sansa
returning
to
their
chambers
where
he
informs
her
that
his
lord
father
has
commanded
him
to
consummate
the
marriage
As
she
undresses
however
he
refuses
to
do
so
and
passes
out
on
a
nearby
chair
Before
she
sleeps
Sansa
tucks
him
in
The
following
morning
Shae
notices
how
Sansas
sheets
are
not
stained
with
blood
and
that
she
is
still
a
virgin
After
the
Red
Wedding
occurs
at
the
Twins
Tywin
calls
a
small
council
meeting
which
Podrick
informs
Tyrion
of
while
he
is
bonding
with
Sansa
Joffrey
plans
to
have
Robb
Starks
head
served
to
Sansa
during
his
wedding
feast
but
Tyrion
retorts
that
she
is
no
longer
his
to
torment
being
Tyrions
wife
now
Joffrey
replies
that
as
king
everyone
is
his
to
torment
When
Tyrion
softly
warns
that
kings
are
dying
like
flies
Joffrey
petuantly
declares
that
he
is
the
king
and
will
punish
Tyrion
for
his
remarks
Tywin
then
says
that
any
man
who
must
declare
himself
king
is
no
true
king
and
reminds
Joffrey
that
he
won
his
war
for
him
When
Joffrey
accuses
his
grandfather
of
hiding
out
under
Casterly
Rock
during
Roberts
Rebellion
Tywin
calmly
but
meanacingly
declares
the
king
is
tired
and
sends
Joffrey
to
bed
commanding
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
give
him
some
essence
of
nightshade
to
help
him
sleep
As
the
small
council
disperses
Tywin
tells
Tyrion
to
stay
behind
Tyrion
expresses
his
disgust
over
the
Red
Wedding
and
Tywin
reveals
that
he
had
a
hand
in
it
promising
rewards
and
titles
to
Walder
Frey
and
Roose
Bolton
seeking
to
protect
their
family
and
end
the
war
Tywin
once
more
commands
Tyrion
to
get
Sansa
pregnant
but
Tyrion
refuses
to
rape
her
He
then
asks
his
father
when
he
has
ever
made
a
decision
solely
for
the
benefit
of
his
family
to
which
Tywin
replies
it
was
the
day
he
was
born
he
let
Tyrion
live
because
of
his
name
and
his
status
as
Tywins
son
despite
Tyrion
being
a
dwarf
and
having
killed
his
beloved
Joanna
Lannister
when
she
gave
birth
to
him
Tyrion
later
finds
Sansa
in
her
chambers
crying
Meanwhile
Jaime
Brienne
Qyburn
and
their
entourage
finally
arrive
in
Kings
Landing
where
Jaime
isnt
even
recognized
due
to
his
poor
condition
He
arrives
at
the
Red
Keep
and
returns
to
his
sister
Season
Tywin
Lannister
has
the
Stark
Valyrian
steel
ancestral
sword
Ice
melted
down
and
reforged
into
two
new
swords
He
gifts
one
to
Jaime
Lannister
and
prompts
Jaime
to
leave
the
Kingsguard
to
resume
his
place
at
Casterly
Rock
as
Tywins
heir
However
Jaime
refuses
enraging
Tywin
When
Jaime
asks
if
his
father
would
like
the
sword
back
Tywin
tells
him
that
a
onehanded
man
with
no
family
will
need
all
the
help
he
can
get
Qyburn
outfits
Jaime
with
a
prosthetic
golden
hand
which
Cersei
believes
is
elegant
despite
Jaime
stating
a
hook
would
be
more
practical
Jaime
tells
Cersei
that
he
is
staying
in
the
Kingsguard
to
stay
by
her
side
but
Cersei
snaps
back
about
how
Jaime
took
too
long
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
by
her
side
and
how
everything
has
changed
They
are
interrupted
by
Cerseis
handmaiden
who
brings
Cersei
important
news
Later
Jaime
discusses
Kingsguard
positions
during
the
royal
wedding
stating
he
shall
guard
the

Trants
chagrin
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
looks
through
The

and
notices
how

empty
then
points
out
how
Jaime
is
old
and
has
lost

that
he
has
sent
his

Prince
Oberyn
Martell
in
his
stead
while
he
remains
at
Sunspear
due
to
his

The

Tyrion
and
his
companions
search
the
city
for

finding

where
he
had
gotten
in
a
brawl
with
two
Lannister

Sansa
Stark
and

After
Tyrion
refuses
to
join

at
Joffreys
behest
Joffrey
pours
wine
on
him
and
names
him
his
cupbearer
Joffrey
intentionally
drops
his

and
kicks
it
under
a
nearby
table
commanding
Tyrion
to
pick
it
up
While
he
crawls

Joffrey
tells

to
fill
it
up
after
he
does

sending

He
tries
to
comfort
his
sister
and

but
she
backs
away
Afterwards
Jaime
becomes
more
aggressive
and
begins
to
force
himself
on
her
and
the
two
proceed
to
have
sex
despite
Cersei
stating
its
an
inappropriate
place
to
perform
Later
Tywin
visits
Oberyn
Martell
at
Littlefingers
brothel
where
he
requests
that
Oberyn
join
him
and
Mace
Tyrell
as
a
judge
for
Tyrions
trial
and
invites
him
to
join
the
Small
Council
Tywin
points
out
how
the
Greyjoys
are
still
in
open
rebellion
and
how
Daenerys
Targaryen
has
three
dragons
which
only
the
Dornish
were
able
to
defeat
during
the
War
of
Conquest
three
centuries
ago
In

Tywin
will
arrange
for

that
if

helps
him
bring

him
how
he
was
approached
to
testify
against

in
exchange
for
a
knighthood
Podrick
tells
Tyrion
that
he
refused
and
Tyrion
commands
that
Podrick
leave
the
capital
for
his

emotionally
leaves

in

who
has
been
training

fight
with
his

behest
implores
him
to
Jaime
recalls
how
Cersei
earlier
asked
Jaime
to
kill
Tyrion
and
bring
her
Sansas
head
which
he
had
refused
to
both
Tyrion
also
denies
a
part
in
Joffreys
murder
which
Jaime
believes
Jaime
points
out
how
Sansa
had
the
most
motive
to
kill
Joffrey
but
Tyrion
doesnt
believe
that
she
did
Later
Jaime
gives
Brienne
of
Tarth
new
armor
and
his
Valyrian
steel
sword
so
that
she
can
bring
Sansa
to
safety
to
fulfill
her
vows
to
Catelyn
Stark
Outside
Kings
Landing

also
gives
her

she
responds
Oathkeeper
Jaime

inquires

it
was
in

Tyrell
and
Petyr
Baelish
She
asks

but
Cersei
doesnt
believe
it
She
asks
that
Oberyn
bring
her
a
ship
as
a
gift
for
her
name
day
which
Cersei
missed
Cersei
then
visits
her
father
who
refuses
to
discuss
the
trial
with
her
Tywin
informs
Cersei
that
they
are
in
tremendous
debt
to
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
due
to
Robert
Baratheons
outrageous
and
reckless
spending
Tywin
tells
Cersei
that
they
need
the
Tyrells
by
their
side
due
to
their
wealth
noting
how
their
gold
mines
in
the
Westerlands
have
run
dry
It
is
the
day
of
Tyrions
trial
At
a
small
council
meeting
Varys
informs
the
bureaucrats
that
Sandor
Clegane
has
slaughtered
Lannister
soldiers
in
the
Riverlands
so
Tywin
places
a
large
bounty
of
silver
stags
on
him
He
goes
on
to
say
that
Daenerys
Targaryen
has
conquered
Slavers

and
rules

as
its
Queen
Whats
more
she
has
acquired
an
army

The
trial
of
Tyrion
Lannister
begins
King
Tommen
sits
out
as
a
judge
with
Tywin
serving
in
his
stead
along
with
Mace
Tyrell
and
Oberyn
Martell
as
Tywin
had
previously
arranged
Tyrion
does
not
confess
to
the
accusations
placed
on
him
by
Cersei
so
the
Crown
calls
forward
a
number
of
witnesses
who
speak
out
against
Tyrion
Many
of
these
witnesses
were
previously
made
enemies
of
Tyrion
during
his
tenure
as
acting
Hand
of
the
King
including
Meryn
Trant
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
and
Cersei
herself
Varys
also
speaks
out
against
Tyrion
when
Tyrion
asks
him
if
Varys
remembers
their
conversation
after
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
Varys
replies
that
he
has
not
forgotten
During
the
recess
Jaime
confronts
Tywin
believing
that
the
whole
trial
is
a
farce
manipulated
by
Cersei
He
strikes
a
deal
with
his
father
he
will
leave
the
Kingsguard
and
assume
his
place
at
Casterly
Rock
if
Tywin
lets
Tyrion
live
Tywin
agrees
promising
to
send
Tyrion
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
As
the
court
reconvenes
Jaime
tells
Tyrion
to
plead
guilty
and
for
mercy
However
when
Shae
is
brought
forward
as
the
Crowns
final
witness
and
lies
that
Tyrion
is
guilty
Tyrion
loses
it
and
lashes
out
at
the
court
stating
that
he
should
have
let
Stannis
Baratheon
kill
them
all
He
then
demands
a
trial
by
combat
much
to
Cersei
and
Tywins
chagrin
and
Jaimes
disappointment
Jaime
confronts
Tyrion
in
his
cell
He
tells
Tyrion
that
he
is
unable
to
fight
for
him
in
his
trial
so
Tyrion
asks
that
he
send
for
Bronn
Before
leaving
he
tells
Tyrion
that
Cersei
plans
on
naming
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
the
Mountain
as
her
champion
Later
Bronn
comes
to
visit
Tyrion
who
is
surprised
to
find
Bronn
in
more
noble
clothing
Bronn
tells
Tyrion
that
he
is
to
wed
Lollys
Stokeworth
Bronn
refuses
to
fight
for
Tyrion
believing
that
the
Mountain
would
defeat
and
kill
him
However
he
wishes
Tyrion
good
luck
Finally
Oberyn
visits
Tyrion
and
tells
him
the
story
of
how
they
first
met
when
Tyrion
had
been
born
their
father
took
him
and
his
sister
Elia
to
Casterly
Rock
where
Cersei
expressed
her
anger
over
her
new
baby
brother
due
to
the
death
of
their
mother
Joanna
Lannister
and
her
hope
for
his
death
which
wounds
Tyrion
Oberyn
then
declares
his
intentions
to
Tyrion
once
more
to
get
justice
for
the
death
of
his
sister
at
the
hands
of
the
Mountain
and
tells
Tyrion
that
he
will
be
his
champion
It
is
the
day
of
the
trial
by
combat
of
Tyrion
Jaime
visits
his
younger
brother
in
his
cell
bringing
him
wine
and
the
two
discuss
their
simple
cousin
Orson
Lannister
Tyrion
ponders
why
Orson
loved
smashing
beetles
expressing
his
dismay
that
so
many
innocent
beetles
had
been
smashed
to
death
and
returned
to
the
dirt
However
the
two
are
unable
to
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
why
Orson
did
it
When
the
bells
ring
an
emotional
Jaime
leaves
but
not
before
wishing
Tyrion
good
luck
Tyrion
is
escorted
to
the
arena
where
he
finds
Oberyn
and
Ellaria
Sand
the
former
of
which
is
wearing
light
armor
no
helmet
and
is
drinking
wine
while
his
squire
Daemon
Sand
polishes
Oberyns
spear
secretly
he
is
outfitting
the
spear
with
manticore
venom
As
Oberyn
walks
out
into
the
arena
Ellaria
grabs
him
telling
him
not
to
die
to
which
Oberyn
replies
that
he
wont
Oberyn
and
the
Mountain
clash
during
which
Oberyn
demands
that
Ser
Gregor
admits
to
the
rape
and
murder
of
his
sister
Elia
and
her
children
that
she
bore
with
her
husband
Rhaegar
Targaryen
Rhaenys
and
Aegon
Though
Oberyn
severely
injures
the
Mountain
cutting
him
on
his
leg
and
piercing
him
through
his
stomach
and
chest
he
refuses
to
kill
him
given
that
the
Mountain
has
not
confessed
As
he
walks
around
the
Mountains
body
demanding
that
he
admit
who
gave
him
the
order
to
kill
his
sister
niece
and
nephew
all
the
while
pointing
at
Tywin
the
Mountain
suddenly
knocks
the
Red
Viper
to
the
ground
He
punches
him
knocking
out
his
teeth
and
climbs
on
top
of
him
where
he
puts
his
fingers
through
Oberyns
eye
sockets
and
confesses
to
Elias
rape
and
murder
as
well
as
the
murder
of
her
children
He
then
tells
Oberyn
how
he
did
it
by
crushing
her
skull
and
does
the
same
to
Oberyn
The
crowd
is
shocked
while
Ellaria
screams
in
horror
Jaime
and
Tyrion
look
on
with
disappointing
and
nervous
looks
while
Cersei
smirks
Tywin
then
stands
and
proclaims
that
Tyrion
is
sentenced
to
death
Afterwards
Cersei
looks
over
the
Mountains
body
in
Pycelles
laboratory
with
Qyburn
and
Pycelle
Pycelle
notes
how
the
poison
used
is
manticore
venom
and
that
he
cannot
be
saved
by
Qyburn
says
there
is
a
way
that
no
maester
is
aware
of
Pycelle
states
that
Qyburn
is
arrogant
and
dangerous
but
Cersei
instead
dismisses
Pycelle
giving
the
laboratory
to
Qyburn
Qyburn
warns
Cersei
that
the
process
may
change
the
Mountain
somewhat
but
will
certainly
not
weaken
him
Later
Cersei
meets
with
her
father
again
telling
Tywin
that
she
does
not
wish
to
marry
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
She
goes
on
to
say
how
she
does
not
want
to
be
removed
from
Kings
Landing
and
shipped
off
to
Highgarden
away
from
her
son
Tommen
which
Tywin
and
the
Tyrells
will
fight
over
to
control
When
Tywin
asks
how
she
will
stop
him
she
says
that
she
will
expose
the
truth
about
her
and
Jaime
and
that
Tywins
legacy
is
a
lie
which
leaves
Tywin
in
denial
Tywin
says
that
he
does
not
believe
her
but
Cersei
knows
that
he
does
leaving
her
father
She
meets
her
brother
in
the
White
Sword
Tower
Jaime
is
angered
that
she
has
allowed
Tyrion
to
die
but
Cersei
says
that
she
chooses
her
family
and
that
she
does
not
love
Tyrion
nor
Tywin
only
him
all
the
while
seducing
Jaime
Jaime
then
throws
Cersei
onto
the
table
where
they
proceed
to
have
sex
The
night
before
Tyrions
trial
Jaime
has
the
guards
knocked
out
and
frees
his
little
brother
telling
him
that
he
is
working
with
Varys
who
has
secured
a
galley
in
the
harbor
The
two
embrace
before
Jaime
departs
but
Tyrion
first
takes
another
path
he
sneaks
into
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
where
he
finds
Shae
in
his
fathers
bed
She
grabs
a
knife
but
Tyrion
rushes
onto
the
bed
and
chokes
his
lover
to
death
weeping
and
apologizing
afterwards
He
then
stares
at
Joffreys
crossbow
on
the
wall
taking
it
and
finding
his
father
on
the
privy
Tyrion
confronts
Tywin
over
wanting
him
dead
all
his
life
and
Tywin
admits
to
it
but
states
that
he
would
never
let
Ilyn
Payne
take
his
head
because
of
his
Lannister
name
Tyrion
tells
his
father
that
he
loved
Shae
and
has
just
murdered
her
much
to
Tywins
surprise
but
he
simply
passes
her
off
as
a
whore
When
Tywin
insists
that
they
return
to
his
chambers
Tyrion
says
that
he
cannot
Shae
is
still
in
there
Tywin
asks
mockingly
if
his
son
is
afraid
of
a
dead
whore
triggering
Tyrion
to
fire
an
arrow
into
his
fathers
chest
Tywin
in
complete
shock
declares
that
Tyrion
is
no
son
of
his
to
which
Tyrion
replies
that
he
has
always
been
his
son
before
firing
another
arrow
into
his
fathers
heart
killing
him
Tyrion
then
goes
to
Varys
who
suspects
that
Tyrion
has
done
something
Varys
places
him
into
a
crate
with
food
and
the
crate
is
placed
no
the
galley
He
initially
walks
towards
the
Red
Keep
but
when
the
bells
begin
to
ring
he
instead
returns
to
the
galley
and
sits
by
Tyrions
crate

Tywin
Lannister
at

Cersei
tells

to
have
the
other
lords
wait
as
she
mourns
over
her
father
whose
body
is
being
protected
by
Jaime
Cersei
goes
on
to
accuse
Jaime
of
being
a
man
of
action
who
does
not
consider
his
consequences
and
expresses
her
desire
to
have
Tyrion
killed
for
murdering
their
father
As
she
leaves
Jaime
looks
on
sadly
at
their
dead
fathers
body

expresses
his
disgust
over

and
pious

he
smuggled
safely
across

to
Tyrion
how
he
was
apart
of
a
group
that

Baratheon
for
the
disaster
that
he
was
and
implores
Tyrion
to
donate
his
services
to
Daenerys
Targaryen
Varys
tells
Tyrion
that
talented
men
have
a
role
to
play
in
the
wars
to
come
and
notes
how
Daenerys
is
stronger
than
King
Tommen
but
gentler
than
King
Stannis
and
that
she
has
the
right
family
name
After

does
not
judge
him
for
being
in
love
with
his
sister
noting
how
the
Targaryens
did
the
same
thing
for
centuries
She
notes
how
society
constantly
changes
it
views
on
who
people
are
meant
to
leave
but
what
never
changes
is
who
people
truly
love
Jaime
is
later
brought
before
Prince
Doran
who
questions
him
as
to

has
been
poisoned
by
the
Sand
Snakes
Tyrion
continues
to
travel
with
Varys
having
agreed
to
meet
with
Daenerys
Targaryen
The
two
make
a
stop
in
Volantis
While
excreting
his
wastes
he
is
suddenly
apprehended
by
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
who
tells
Tyrion
he
intends
to
take
him
to
the
queen
Tyrion
later
realizes
that
Jorah
conveniently
means
Daenerys
and
not
his
sister
Cersei
who
has
placed
a
bounty
on
Tyrions
head
During
their
journey
Tyrion
and
Jorah
form
a
bond
of
sorts
In
Old
Valyria
Tyrion
is
shocked
to
see
one
of
Daenerys
dragons
Drogon
flying
above
the
ruins
Shortly
afterwards
they
are
attacked
by
a
group
of
stone
men
Tyrion
does
not
make
contact
with
them
but
Jorah
is
secretly
touched
by
one
giving
him
greyscale
the
disease
that
turns
men
into
stone
men
Tyrion
later
inadvertently
informs
Jorah
of
the
death
of
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
the
th
Lord
Commander
of
the
Nights
Watch
who
mourns
him
Tyrion
and
Jorah
are
eventually
captured
by
a
group
of
slavers
and
are
sold
into
the
services
of
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
who
will
have
his
freedmen
fight
in
the
fighting
pits
for
the
Queen
of
Meereen
Daenerys
Targaryen
Jorah
uses
this
opportunity
to
present
Daenerys
with
a
gift
Tyrion
who
walks
into
the
pits
and
informs
Daenerys
that
he
is
the
gift
Tyrion
and
Jorah
are
brought
before
Daenerys
in
one
of
the
pyramids
in
Meereen
one
of
the
cities
of
Slavers
Bay
which
she
has
conquered
from
the
slave
masters
Tyrion
advises
Daenerys
not
to
execute
Jorah
since
executing
those
devote
to
her
is
unwise
but
says
that
she
cannot
allow
a
known
traitor
around
her
either
Tyrion
also
expresses
his
thoughts
that
Jorah
is
likely
in
love
with
Daenerys
Thus
Daenerys
emotionally
sends
Jorah
back
into
exile
and
has
him
removed
from
the
city
Daenerys
later
meets
with
Tyrion
where
she
agrees
not
to
have
him
killed
to
send
a
message
to
House
Lannister
Instead
Daenerys
will
have
Tyrion
advise
her
on
how
to
get
what
she
wants
the
Iron
Throne
Tyrion
wonders
aloud
if
she
should
remain
in
Slavers
Bay
but
Daenerys
says
that
Westeros
is
her
home
not
Essos
Daenerys
goes
onto
tell
Tyrion
that
she
intends
to
break
the
wheel
of

during
an
event
in
the

Tyrion
notes
how
his
father
would
have
liked
Hizdahr
They
are
shocked
to
see
that
the
champion
of
the
competition
is
none
other
than
Jorah
himself
Suddenly
Jorah
grabs
a
spear
and
throws
it
towards
Daenerys
direction
it
instead
hits
a
member
of
the
Sons
of
the

an
insurgency

of
the
Great
Masters
the

who
ruled

Suddenly
the

rise
from
the
crowd
and
begin
to
slaughter
the
audience
the
Unsullied
and
the
Second

as
panic
spreads
In
the
ensuing
massacre
Hizdahr
is
stabbed
to

by
the
insurgents
Tyrion
slits
the
throat
of
one
of
the
insurgents
that
nearly
kills
Missandei
and
with
Jorah
and
Daarios
help
the
five
leap
off
the

and
attempt
to

However
the

are
shut
and
they
find
themselves
surrounded
by
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
with
few
Unsullied
left
to

them
Daenerys
closes
her

and
suddenly
Drogon
flies
into
the
pit
and
begins
to
burn
the
rebel

who
flee
out
of

Daenerys
climbs
atop

and
flies
away
from
the
city
as
Tyrion
Missandei
Jorah
and
Daario
watch
on
in
awe
Back
at
the
Great
Pyramid
Jorah
and
Daario
decide
to
go
looking
for
Daenerys
while
Tyrion
Missandei
and
Grey
Worm
are
left
behind
to
govern
the
city
in
her
stead
As
Tyrion
watches
Daario
and
Jorah
depart
he
is
approached
by
Varys
who
expresses
his
delight
that
Tyrion
has
made
it
into
Daenerys
service
Tyrion
says
that
it
would
help
him
govern
the
city
if
he
had
someone
with
a
vast
network
of
spies
and
tells
Varys
how
he
missed
him
while
they
were
apart
After
being
assaulted
at
a
brothel
by
the
radical
Sparrows
for
mocking
the
Seven
the
High
Septon
demands
justice
from
the
small
council
Cersei
sees
this
as
an
opportunity
to
undermine
House
Tyrell
whose
influence
has
grown
stronger
and
stronger
over
her
young
son
King
Tommen
She
has
the
High
Septon
thrown
into
the
dungeons
beneath
the
Red
Keep
and
meets
with
the
socalled
High
Sparrow
who
is
serving
soup
to
the
smallfolk
of
Kings
Landing
Cersei
goes
on
to
have
her
son
appoint
the
High
Sparrow
as
the
new
High
Septon
and
has
the
Faith
Militant
reestablished
with
the
bulk
of
the
forces
being
made
up
of
the
Sparrows
of
course
She
informs
the
High
Sparrow
of
Ser
Loras
Tyrells
perversions
which
are
seen
as
a
sin
in
the
eyes
of
the
Faith
As
a
result
Loras
is
arrested
by
a
group
led
by
Brother
Lancel
At
a
subsequent
hearing
for
Loras
attended
by
Cersei
Tommen
Olenna
Tyrell
Loras
grandmother
and
Margaery
Tyrell
Loras
sister
and
Tommens
wife
Margaery
testifies
for
her
brother
However
a
squire
named
Olyvar
who
is
secretly
in
the
service
of
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
provides
sufficient
evidence
of
Loras
perversions
As
a
result
both
of
the
Tyrell
children
are
arrested
Cersei
smirks
at
the
shocked
Olenna
over
her
victory
Earlier
Cersei
had
met
with
Baelish
to
extract
this
information
from
him
Baelish
also
informed
Cersei
that
Sansa
Stark
has
returned
to
Winterfell
and
is
being
wed
to
Ramsay
Bolton
Cersei
believes
that
Sansa
played
a
part
in
King
Joffreys
murder
and
agrees
to
have
Baelish
appointed
as
Warden
of
the
North
if
he
defeats
the
Boltons
in
the
name
of
House
Lannister
Baelish
who
has
control
over
the
armies
of
House
Arryn
the
rulers
of
the
Vale
pledges
to
use
the
elite
knights
of
the
Vale
to
defend
the
Iron
Throne
and
promises
that
he
will
not
rest
until
the
banner
of
House
Lannister
flies
over
Winterfell
Olenna
later
meets
with
Littlefinger
who
promises
her
the
same
gift
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
After
checking
on
Margaery
Cersei
meets
with
the
High
Sparrow
and
tells
him
that
she
believes
Margaerys
conditions
are
fine
The
High
Sparrow
declares
his
intentions
to
strip
the
nobility
of
their
wealth
and
power
to
expose
them
for
who
they
truly
are
At
that
moment
Lancel
walks
out
from
the
shadows
having
confessed
of
his
sins
Realizing
their
intentions
Cersei
attempts
to
leave
but
is
apprehended
by
Septa
Unella
and
locked
away
During
her
time
in
prison
she
is
met
by
Qyburn
an
expelled
maester
who
helped
heal
Jaimes
wound
and
has
been
experimenting
on
the
deceased
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
Qyburn
informs
her
that
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
has
called
for
her
uncle
Kevan
to
serve
as
Hand
of
the
King
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
and
that
both
Pycelle
and
Kevan
refuse
to
visit
her
He
also
informs
Cersei
that
Tommen
has
fallen
into
a
state
of
depression
and
is
refusing
to
eat
He
implores
Cersei
to
confess
so
that
she
may
return
to
her
son
but
Cersei
refuses
to
give
the
High
Sparrow
that
satisfaction
However
Cersei
later
decides
to
finally
give
in
She
confesses
to
some
of
her
sins
but
denies
any
involvement
in
sleeping
with
her
brother
Jaime
and
conspiring
to
murder
her
late
husband
King
Robert
Because
she
confesses
to
some
sins
but
not
all
Cersei
must
still
have
a
trial
however
if
she
undergoes
a
humiliating
walk
of
atonement
she
may
return
to
the
Red
Keep
Reluctantly
Cersei
agrees
to
do
so
Her
hair
is
cut
and
she
is
stripped
naked
and
forced
to
walk
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
as
Septa
Unella
rings
a
bell
next
to
her
shouting
Shame
and
the
smallfolk
throw
food
and
wastes
at
her
Her
feet
bloodied
she
finally
makes
it
back
to
the
Red
Keep
where
Qyburn
rushes
to
her
and
warps
her
in
a
cloak
as
Kevan
Pycelle
and
Lord
Mace
Tyrell
Olennas
son
watch
on
Qyburn
then
introduces
her
to
the
undead
and
silent
Gregor
Clegane
who
carries
a
vengeful
Cersei
off
Season
Because
of
Cerseis
arrest
and
walk
of
atonement
her
uncle
Ser
Kevan
Lannister
is
called
upon
by
Grand
Maester

I
Cerseis
son
Cersei
is
delighted
when
she
hears
that
her
brother
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
has
returned
from
Dorne
but
when
the
ship
comes
in
she
soon
realizes
the
ugly
truth
that
her
daughter
Princess
Myrcella
Baratheon
is
dead
having
been
poisoned
by
Ellaria
Sand
and
the
Sand
Snakes
Cersei
mourns

as
Jaime
promises
that
they
will
take
back
everything
that
has
been
taken
from
them
their
power

and
Jaime
later
attend
a
meeting
of
the
small
council
despite
not
holding
positions
on
it
Lady
Olenna
Tyrell
has
been
summoned
to
Kings
Landing
to
advise
the
council
on
freeing
her
grandchildren
from
the
clutches
of
the
Sparrowcontrolled
Faith
Militant
Jaime
and
Cersei
attempt
to
intervene
even
though
they
are
reminded
by
their
uncle
Kevan
that
they
do
not
sit
on
the
council
Jaime
mentions
that
House
Martell
has
been
overthrown
by
the
same
people
that
murdered
Myrcella
However
they
are
simply
ignored
as
Kevan
Olenna
Pycelle
and
Mace
Tyrell
leave
the
room
noting
that
while
they
cannot
make
Cersei
and
Jaime
leave
they
are
able
to
leave
themselves
Cersei
Jaime
and
the
undead
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
later
meet
with
Qyburn
who
has
secured
some
of
the
little
birds
left
behind
in
Kings
Landing
by
Varys
Cersei
commands
Qyburn
to
send
his
little
birds
across
the
country
and
find
anyone
who
is
insulting
House
Lannister
and
plotting
against
their
house
Jaime
questions
if
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
has
officially
levied
charges
against
her
Cersei
is
relaxed
however
as
she
is
confident
that
she
can
use
the
Mountain
in
a
trial
by
combat
if
her
trial
is
to
still
be
held
Cersei
is
later
told
a
secret
by
Tommen
who
has
spoken
with
the
High
Sparrow
that
Margaery
Tyrell
the
Queen
Consort
and
Olennas
granddaughter
is
to
have
a
walk
of
atonement
herself
Cersei
and
Jaime
plot
with
Olenna
and
Kevan
to
prevent
this
from
happening
Kevan
who
bears
no
love
for
the
Sparrows
due
to
his
sons
Lancel
Lannister
affiliation
with
the
radical
sect
will
keep
the
gates
of
Kings
Landing
open
while
Olenna
and
Mace
Tyrell
will
march
a
group
of
the
Tyrell
army
into
the
city
to
confront
the
Faith
Militant
Jaime
and
Mace
lead
the
army
to
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
where
the
High
Sparrow
is
delivering
a
speech
to
the
smallfolk
of
the
city
in
preparation
for
Margaerys
walk
of
atonement
The
two
sides
face
an
intense
standoff
Jaime
gallops
up
the
steps
atop
his
horse
demanding
that
in
King
Tommen
Is
name
they
release
the
Tyrells
though
the
High
Sparrow
rebukes
this
by
claiming
that
the
gods
do
not
recognize
his
authority
in
such
a
matter
When
Jaime
threatens
to
have
all
the
Sparrows
killed
the
High
Sparrow
claims
that
they
yearn
to
die
in
service
to
the
gods
Before
a
slaughter
can
ensue
however
the
High
Sparrow
proclaims
that
Margaerys
walk
of
atonement
will
not
be
necessary
as
she
has
helped
cement
a
new
alliance
between
the
crown
and
the
faith
Suddenly
King
Tommen
walks
down
the
steps
and
joins
his
wife
and
the
High
Sparrow
Subsequently
Jaime
is
dismissed
from
the
Kingsguard
for
marching
against
the
faith
and
thus
the
crown
Tommen
commands
Jaime
to
assist
House
Frey
in
taking
back

has
been
recaptured
by
the
resurgent
House
Tully
army
commanded
by
Ser
Brynden
Tully
the
Blackfish
Jaime
meets
with
Cersei
one
last
time
enraged
that
the
High
Sparrow
has
taken
their
son
away
from
them
Cersei
tells
Jaime
to
go
however
to
remind
the
people
of
the
power
of
House
Lannister
and
reassures
him
that
she
will
be
able
to
use
the
Mountain
in
a
trial
by
combat
should
it
come
up
when
Jaime
is
not
present
in
the
capital
Jaime
arrives
in
the
Riverlands
with
troops
and
Ser
Bronn
at
his
side
who
has
been
promised
lordship
and
a
new
high
born
wife
after
he
previously
left
Lady
Lollys
Stokeworth
when
he
was
recruited
on
Jaimes
mission
to
Dorne
Bronn
notes
how
the
Freys
siege
is
a
disaster
and
Jaime
marches
the
army
into
the
Frey
camp
to
meet
with
Lothar
Frey
and
Walder
Rivers
who
have
been
commanded
by
their
aging
father
Lord
Walder
Frey
to
take
back

assumes
command
of
the
siege
and
orders
for

and
the
one
who

and
fed

later
parlays
with
the
Brynden
the
Blackfish
saying
that
his
men
will
be
able
to
breach
Riverruns
defenses
and
will
slaughter
every
last
Tully
soldier
The
Blackfish
retorts
that
they
have
enough
provisions
and
supplies
to
last
for
two
years
When
Jaime
accuses
the
Blackfish
of
having
no
intention
to
save
the
lives
of
his
men
and
asks
why
he
even
agreed
to
the
parley
the
Blackfish
replies
that
he
simply
wanted
to
get
a
look
at
him
The
Blackfish
then
says
that
he
is
disappointed
visibly
hurting
Jaime
who
considers
the
Blackfish
to
be
one
of
his
personal
heroes
due
to
his
role
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny

Brienne
talks
with
Jaime
inside

agrees
to
allow

can
try
to
persuade
him
to
march
the
Tully
army
north
to
help
Sansa
retake
her
family
home
Winterfell
Brienne
meets
with
the
Brynden
the
Blackfish
who
immediately
refuses

The
Blackfish
gets
emotional
when
he
reads
Sansas
letter
noting
how
she
is
just
like
her
mother
Catelyn
Stark
his
niece
However
he
still
refuses
to
march
the
Tully

Frey
forces
At
the
castle
the
Blackfish
orders
the
Tully
captain
not
to
open
the
gates
and
let
Edmure
in
but
the
captain
and
his
men
refuse
to
obey
noting
that
Edmure
is
their
rightful
Lord
of
Riverrun
Realizing
he
is
outnumbered
the
Blackfish
walks
away
as
the
gates
are
lowered
Edmure
enters
the
castle
and
meets
with
the
captain
ordering
him
to
command
the
soldiers
to
lay
down

Realizing
that
the
Blackfish
was
right
the
captain
reluctantly
gives
the
command

which
saddens
Jaime
Jaime
later
watches
as
Brienne
and
Podrick
sail
away
Brienne
raises
a
hand
as
a
way
of
saying
goodbye
and
Jaime
raises
his
right
golden
hand
back
rather
than
having
his
men
seize
the
two

royal
announcement
though
Cersei
is
not
informed
of
this
Kevan
does
not
permit
her

are
to
be
held

the
first
day
of

is
shocked
by
this
as
she
will
no
longer
be
able
to
use
the

to
defend
her
As
she
walks
away
Qyburn
informs
her
that

sins
that
he
has
been
accused
of
including
sleeping
with

Baratheon
and
having
sexual
relations
with

agrees
to
spread
the
light
of

henceforth
as
Brother
Loras

they

Cersei
of
the
catastrophic
casualties
his
army
suffered
Cersei
remains
stubborn
and
states
she
will
hire
mercenaries
to
reinforce
their
armies
Jaime
and
Tyrion
later
meet
up
beneath
the
Red
Keep
and
discuss
a
potential
cease
fire
though
Jaime
is
still
sour
towards
Tyrion
for
the
death
of
their
father
Cersei
later
reveals
to
Jamie
that
she
is
pregnant
with
their
child
and
that
she
is
no
longer
afraid
to
let
her
kingdom
know
of
it
Military
strength
House
Lannister
can
raise
approximately
men
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
As
the
richest
house
the
Lannisters
forces
are
among
the
bestequipped
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
though
House
Tyrell
commands
larger
numbers
However
the
strength
of
House
Lannister
has
been
badly
depleted
due
to
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
between
the
Battle
of
Blackwater
and
the
battles
with
Robb
Stark
such
as
the
Battle
of
Oxcross
Nevertheless
It
is
clear
that
House
Lannister
is
still
able
to
field
tens
of
thousands
of
men
even
after
the
losses
suffered
against
Robb
Stark
Casterly
Rock
alone
has
a
garrison
of
Lannister
soldiers
showing
that
the
Lannisters
still
command
a
considerable
amounts
of
men
However
much
of
this
army
is
later
annihilated
by
the
Targaryen
forces
at
the
Battle
of
the
Goldroad
dealing
a
crippling
bow
to
the
already
massively
depleted
Lannister
forces
House
Lannister
takes
Highgarden
Lannister
soldiers
seem
to
be
more
wellequipped
than
any
other
army
that
Westeros
could
muster
This
is
particularly
evidenced
by
the
high
quality
swords
forged
directly
in
the
Crownlands
and
Westerlands
by
skilled
smithies
and
armorers
and
other
high
quality
infantry
and
cavalry
weapons
such
as
spears
supplied
to
the
Lannister
soldiers
An
advanced
degree
of
standardization
is
clearly
displayed
to
an
extent
which
outmatches
even
the
Tyrell
forces
The
weapons
of
House
Lannister
even
include
Scorpion
ballistae
as
of
Season
Not
only
this
but
commonly
it
is
seen
that
the
Lannisters
are
outfitted
in
excellent
grade
armor
Many
of
them
protected
by
sturdy
reddyed
leather
coated
over
augmented
steel
armor
plates
in
a
striking
combination
This
smart
design
is
not
only
aesthetically
impressive
as
per
Lannister
lavishness
but
also
ergonomically
practical
with
the
segmented
armor
allowing
for
ample
mobility
and
flexibility
for
the
wearer
This
makes
them
more
nimble
than
other
soldiers
who
might
be
wearing
basic
plates
of
armor
with
minimal
if
any
segmentation
while
retaining
the
strong
defensive
properties
They
also
have
crested
steel
and
leather
helmets
with
uniquely
designed
cheek
visors
which
overlap
when
locked
shut
forming
a
broad
facial
plate
with
small
eye
slots
which
still
give
good
visibility
The
horizontally
arrayed
crests
on
their
helmets
are
a
kind
of
defensive
feature
less
often
seen
in
most
other
military
forces
being
designed
to
block
all
but
the
most
brutal
strikes
to
their
heads
denying
contact
to
the
surface
of
the
helmet
and
wearers
head
underneath
it
at
least
in
theory
When
the
facial
visors
are
opened
the
soldier
can
get
a
better
view
of
their
surrounding
vicinity
as
well
as
talk
with
or
to
civilians
more
personally
in
their
patrol
duties
or
guard
duties
The
design
allows
more
options
than
youd
get
in
a
simple
helmet
The
closed
visors
also
give
a
deliberate
resemblance
to
the
face
of
a
lion
looking
directly
forward
towards
it
Arguably
the
design
is
as
much
for
show
as
for
practical
effectiveness
The
intricacy
required
for
manufacturing
tens
of
thousands
of
the
small
parts
for
the
helmets
indicates
a
superior
level
of
metalworking
and
craftsmanship
As
seen
at
Highgarden
the
forward
marching
Lannister
army
is
visually
spectacular
in
full
battle
formation
as
witnessed
by
the
solemnly
onlooking
Queen
of
Thorns
Lannister
armor
and
robes
also
use
logically
vast
quantities
of
relatively
expensive
amounts
of
scarlet
red
and
blood
red
dye
across
the
Lannister
military
forces
universally
Cloaks
robes
and
under
layers
padding
the
armor
in
these
colors
make
for
fine
looking
soldiers
dressed
in
the
best
that
money
can
buy
Moreover
they
are
well
protected
by
ovate
and
rounded
kite
shaped
shields
constructed
of
thick
wood
in
multiple
layers
Adorning
these
are
intricately
carved
lions
and
painted
blazonssigils
of
House
Lannister
red
and
yellowgold
being
the
main
color
palette
The
ubiquitous
style
of
the
Lannister
garments
and
armor
indicates
an
organised
system
of
military
procurement
to
militarily
efficient
standards
However
while
most
Lannister
soldiers
indeed
seem
to
have
the
classic
reddyed
leather
and
steel
segmented
plate
armor
some
even
having
golden
embellishments
over
their
shoulder
plates
and
helmets
perhaps
indicating
high
ranks
among
certain
units
it
would
be
untrue
to
suggest
all
Lannister
footsoldiers
are
as
fortunate
as
to
possess
such
high
quality
armor
Elite
Guards
units
and
what
we
may
hold
to
be
the
professional
fulltime
regular
infantry
majority
are
supplied
with
the
highend
equipment
we
typically
see
Lannister
soldiers
wearing
Yet
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
as
well
as
Daenerys
Targaryens
Invasion
of
Westeros
we
see
prime
examples
of
what
we
might
refer
to
as
levies
or
regionallocal
militia
dressed
in
far
more
basic
leather
armor
and
simple
garments
The
form
this
boiled
dark
brown
or
black
leather
body
armor
takes
is
apparently
an
interlocking
lamellar
armor
of
a
simple
yet
reasonable
quality
hardwearing
enough
for
active
duty
in
both
the
field
and
in
guard
duty
but
far
cheaper
and
lighter
It
represents
a
quality
hierarchy
in
military
forces
with
reserveconscript
levies
thrown
into
the
line
of
duty
with
by
Lannister
standards
relatively
poor
equipment
Though
still
clearly
a
minority
among
the
Lannister
forces
as
the
wars
have
severely
depleted
the
Lannisters
there
seems
to
be
somewhat
more
of
these
men
being
drafted
in
to
save
money
This
makes
sense
as
House
Lannister
is
far
weaker
now
in
Season
than
it
once
was
particularly
after
the
devastation
of
the
Host
of
Casterly
Rock
by
the
Dothraki
and
Drogon
This
form
of
levymilitia
level
armor
can
be
seen
in
the
Battle
of
Oxcross
where
King
Robb
Stark
devastated
a
local
Westerlands
army
hastily
thrown
together
by
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
The
battle
was
extremely
one
sided
with
the
Northmen
being
better
fighters
better
armed
and
achieving
complete
surprise
tearing
the
Lannister
men
apart
Tyrion
later
points
out
that
the
Lannister
army
at
Oxcross
was
mostly
formed
by
inexperienced
green
conscripts
scraped
together
from
Lannisport
and
the
surrounding
areas
to
try
to
make
up
for
the
shattering
loss
of
Jaimes
regular
field
army
at
Whispering
Wood
While
training
the
new
raw
recruits
in
their
camp
near
the
village
of
Oxcross
Stafford
Lannister
cousin
of
Tywin
Lannister
and
brother
of
his
late
wife
felt
so
confident
that
he
was
safe
from
Stark
attack
in
the
heart
of
the
Westerlands
that
he
didnt
even
bother
to
post
sentries
Stark
soldiers
inflicted
a
ratio
of
kills
at
Oxcross
virtually
annihilating
the
Lannister
force
with
minimal
losses
of
their
own
to
do
so
Lightly
armored
Lannister
levies
are
also
seen
throughout
the
Siege
of
Casterly
Rock
with
at
least
as
many
lesser
armored
Lannister
soldiers
to
be
seen
as
the
plate
armored
regulars
Jaime
left
only
doomed
soldiers
to
put
up
a
token
defense
there
emulating
Robbs
strategy
at
Whispering
Wood
and
the
Green
Fork
with
the
elite
Unsullied
utterly
overpowering
the
badly
outnumbered
defenders
Completely
wiped
out
the
diversion
force
at
Casterly
Rock
likely
included
many
levies
from
Lannisport
and
Casterly
Rock
with
the
only
high
quality
infantry
regulars
being
interspersed
among
these
along
with
the
even
lighter
armored
Lannister
archers
The
Unsullied
under
Greyworm
are
shown
to
defeat
large
numbers
of
these
light
infantry
with
one
of
the
Lannister
men
being
easily
skewered
to
a
door
something
probably
impossible
to
do
with
a
short
range
manual
throw
to
a
fully
armored
Lannister
regularelite
guardsmen
unless
hitting
through
the
neck
Clearly
these
levies
are
weaker
combatants
with
Greyworm
killing
dozens
on
his
own
The
Host
of
Casterly
Rock
taken
to
sack
Highgarden
also
had
unknown
numbers
of
lighter
Lannister
infantry
but
clearly
very
many
thousands
of
top
quality
guardsmen
too
comprising
the
backbone
of
the
army
under
Jaime
at
a
glance
Lannister
guards
are
corruptible
in
Kings
Landing
and
have
been
seen
accepting
bribes
though
they
are
not
as
corrupted
as
the
Gold
Cloaks
who
even
had
split
loyalties
to
either
Cersei
or
Tywin
in
the
wake
of
Tyrions
injuries
at
the
Blackwater
whereas
the
Lannister
soldiers
generally
followed
Tywin
or
Cersei
simultaneously
unlike
the
Gold
Cloaks
who
were
rather
more
preferential
to
one
or
the
other
man
to
man
Lannister
soldiers
also
had
an
openly
low
regard
and
disdain
for
many
commoners
in
Kings
Landing
seeing
them
as
scum
This
opinion
was
shared
by
many
of
the
Gold
cloaks
too
in
the
way
they
are
shown
to
talk
to
civilians
They
even
spoke
rudely
to
Yoren
a
Nights
Watchman
no
less
The
Lannisters
also
command
a
modest
fleet
berthed
at
Lannisport
The
original
fleet
belonging
to
Lord
Tywin
directly
was
largely
destroyed
at
anchor
during
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
in
a
preemptive
strike
led
by
Balon
Greyjoys
brothers
Euron
and
Victarion
It
is
indicated
in
the
books
that
this
fleet
was
eventually
rebuilt
by
the
embarrassed
Tywin
though
it
has
not
been
seen
in
the
television
series
not
even
in
the
Siege
of
Casterly
Rock
and
whether
or
not
the
Lannisport
fleet
remained
at
Lannisport
leaving
Eurons
Iron
Fleet
to
do
all
the
work
or
instead
whether
it
was
sent
elsewhere
is
as
yet
unknown
In
summary
the
Lannister
military
is
best
suitedstrongest
on
land
when
led
properly
as
shown
at
the
Green
Fork
and
fields
the
best
equipped
infantry
and
potentially
the
best
cavalry
on
paper
though
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
probably
rival
any
cavalry
the
Lannisters
have
on
quality
if
not
numbers
as
well
now
It
is
dangerous
in
open
field
battles
and
ambushes
but
has
proven
vulnerable
to
attacks
from
the
North
the
Stormlands
and
Dragonstone
and
now
the
Dothraki
and
Unsullied
Notably
even
the
Lannisters
are
no
match
for
dragons
though
it
is
unknown
how
many
scorpion
ballistae
they
have
thanks
to
Qyburn
now
the
only
known
artillery
piece
shown
being
lost
to
dragonfire
in
battle
The
Lannisters
have
held
sway
with
the
threat
of
their
potent
military
since
shortly
after
Roberts
Rebellion
ended
However
depleted
by
wars
and
hardships
the
glory
days
of
House
Lannisters
army
is
by
now
already
long
gone
Queen
Cersei
wishes
to

Company

from
Essos
to
help
augment
and
boost
their
forces
back
up
to

healthy
level
Whether
or
not
the
Lannister
military
can
survive
the
coming
turmoil
yet
to
unfold
is
unknown

branches
House
Lannister
is
a
very
old
and
wealthy
family
dating
back
to
the
Age
of
Heroes
and
the
Andal
invasion
years
ago
As
a
result
it
has
produced
numerous
cadet
branches
and
distant
cousins
of
the
main
line
who
have
prospered
as
members
of
the
minor
nobility
in
the
Westerlands
for
many
years
In
contrast
while
House
Stark
is
even
older
than
House
Lannister
due
to
the
harsh
conditions
of
the
North
both
low
economic
output
and
threat
of
Wildling
attacks
by
the
time
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
the
Starks
possess
few
if
any
cousins
and
only
one
major
cadet
branch
House
Karstark
Therefore
there
are
numerous
minor
members
of
the
extended
House
Lannister
which
exist
in
the
background
of
the
narrative
but
they
are
so
numerous
and
distantly
related
that
members
of
the
main
line
wouldnt
think
to
mention
them
any
more
than
they
would

other

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
House
Lannister
was
established
many
thousands
of
years
prior
to
the
books
opening
by
a
tricksterhero
called
Lann
the
Clever
who
tricked
the
powerful
Casterly
family
into
abandoning
their
stronghold
of
Casterly
Rock
which
the
Lannisters
took
for
their
own
The
Lannisters
have
ruled
the
region
known
as
the
Westerlands
ever
since
getting
rich
off
the
many
gold
and
silver
mines
in
the
western
hills
and
mountains
During
Roberts
Rebellion
the
Lannisters
sat
out
most
of
the
war
refusing
to
heed
the
calls
of
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
to
aid
him
in
crushing
the
rebellion
After
the
rebel
victory
at
the
Battle
of
the
Trident
the
Lannister
army
marched
to
the
relief
of
Kings
Landing
but
instead
of
helping
defend
the
city
they
brutally
sacked
it
killing
King
Aerys
and
his
grandchildren
Robert
Baratheon
publicly
forgave
the
Lannisters
their
actions
and
accepted
their
allegiance
marrying
Cersei
Lannister
in
thanks
for
Tywins
assistance
However
Eddard
Stark
saw
the
Lannister
action
as
betrayal
and
murder
and
has
not
trusted
them
ever
since
House
Lannister
consists
of
a
main
branch
led
by
Lord
Tywin
and
a
junior
branch
led
by
cousins
that
controls
the
city
of
Lannisport
The
Lannisters
are
a
relatively
large
family
though
nowhere
near
as
numerous
as
the
Freys
of
the
Crossing
A
minor
change
is
that
in
the
books
the
heraldry
of
House
Lannister
features
a
lion
passant
striding
on
all
four
legs
but
in
the
TV
series
the
lion
is
rampant
rearing
up
with
its
forepaws
raised
to
attack
The
variant
with
the
striding
passant
lion
is
still
glimpsed
on
several
occasions
in
the
TV
series
ie
Tywins
battleflags
during
the
Battle
of
the
Green
Fork
though
it
is
not
the
primary
version
featured
in
promotional
materials
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and
crew
Lannister
is
pronounced
LANisster
It
rhymes
with
Lancaster
The
conflict
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
in
the
series
is
loosely
inspired
by
the
English
War
of
the
Roses
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters

Lannister
third
son
of
Ser
Kevan
Lannister
is
taken
prisoner
As
Tyrion
points
out
the
Lannister
army
was
mostly
composed
of
green
conscripts
scraped
together
from
Lannisport
and
surrounding
areas
to
try
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
Jaimes
army
at
Whispering
Wood
While
training
the
new
raw
recruits
in
their
camp
near
the
village
of
Oxcross
Stafford
Lannister
cousin
of
Tywin
Lannister
and
brother
of
his
late
wife
felt
so
confident
that
he
was
safe
from
Stark
attack
in
the
heart
of
the
Westerlands
that
he
didnt
even
bother
to
post
sentries
The
Stark
force
is
able
to
achieve
a
surprise
assault
because
they
used
a
previously
unknown
path
through
the
border
mountains
of
the
Westerlands
discovered
by
Grey
Wind
This
allows
the
Stark
army
to
bypass
the
Golden
Tooth
castle
a
predictable
choke
point
which
guards
the
only
major
road
leading
through
the
mountains
between
the
Riverlands
and
the
interior
of
the
Westerlands
Oxcross
is
more
of
a
rout
than
a
pitched
battle
with
the
surprised
Lannister
army
massacred
in
its
own
camp
Brynden
Tully
led
the
vanguard
of
Robbs
army
Robbs
direwolf
Grey
Wind
played
an
important
role
in
the
battle
by
sneaking
into
the
Lannister
camp
and
panicking
their
horses
who
had
never
seen
a
wolf
of
such
massive
size
before
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
himself
was
killed
while
chasing
after
his
terrified
horse
The
Lannister
survivors
regrouped
at
Lannisport
under
Ser
Daven
Lannister
Staffords
son
and
widely
considered
to
be
a
more
intelligent
commander
than
his
father
Numbers
The
book
version
of
Robb
Starks
campaign
is
more
detailed
with
several
major
differences
In
particular
Robbs
army
divided
into
two
major
parts
before
reaching
the
Whispering
Wood
with
cavalry
going
west
with
Robb
to
Riverrun
and
infantry
going
east
to
fight
Tywin
at
the
Green
Fork
in
a
feint
In
the
books
this
eastern
Stark
army
is
commanded
by
Roose
Bolton
who
is
able
to
retreat
from
the
Battle
of
the
Green
Fork
in
good
order
In
the
TV
series
the
feint
only
consists
of
men
and
is
completely
destroyed
Robb
has
men
with
him
at
the
Whispering
Wood
The
Riverlords
under
House
Tully
then
throw
their
support
behind
Robb
drastically
increasing
the
size
of
his
army
Robb
then
invades
the
Westerlands
with
cavalry
The
number
of
Lannister
soldiers
in
the
Riverlands
has
been
doubled
in
the
TV
series
from
to
The
books
state
that
green
Lannister
conscripts
were
killed
at
Oxcross
and
the
few
survivors
scattered
The
exact
figure
isnt
given
in
the
TV
series
though
they
do
state
that
the
army
was
destroyed
and
thousands
of
Lannister
soldiers
are
dead
A
figure
of
a
five
to
one
kill
ratio
would
result
in
a
higher
number
of
Stark
dead
than
in
the
books
in
which
the
battle

A

is
a
public
ritual

punishment
and
penance
in
the

the

It

a

History
Season
Cersei
prepares
for
her
Walk
of
atonement
After
being
caught
at
a
brothel
in
the
middle
of
a
session
of
blasphemous
sexual
roleplay
the
High
Septon
is
trapped
by
a
group
of
Sparrows
stripped
of
all
his
clothes
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
while
one
of
the
Sparrows
publicly
names
him
a
sinner
and
beats
his
hands
to
keep
him
from
covering
his
genitalia
Cersei
endures
her
punishment
After
a
time
imprisoned
by
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
Queen
Cersei
confesses
to
having
committed
adultery
with
her
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
who
had
joined
the
Faith
Militant
and
accused
her
of
adultery
incest
and
regicide
The
High
Sparrow
informs
Cersei
that
she
will
still
be
tried
for
the
other
two
charges
that
she
denies
while
allowing
her
to
return
to
the
Red
Keep
only
if
she
performs
a
walk
of
atonement
as
penance
for
her
confessed
sin
Cerseis
hair
is
cut
short
and
then
she
is
presented
to
the
population
of
Kings
Landing
so
they
will
bear
witness
to
her
confession
and
penitence
She
is
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
made
to
walk
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
to
the
Red
Keep
escorted
by
members
of
the
Faith
Militant
who
keep
away
the
leering
and
jeering
crowds
who
have
gathered
to
see
her
shame
and
take
the
chance
to
insult
their
hated
Queen
Mother
As
she
walks
Septa
Unella
accompanies
her
repeatedly
crying
out
Shame
and
ringing
a
bell
to
attract
peoples
attention
Season
When
King
Tommen
Baratheon
becomes
loyal
to
the
faith
the
High
Sparrow
tells
him
that
his
wife
Margaery
Tyrell
must
perform
a
walk
of
atonement
He
is
reluctant
to
tell
his
mother
after
being
counseled
by
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
however
he
later
tells
Cersei
At
a
Small
Council
meeting
Cersei
informs
Olenna
Tyrell
that
Margaery
will
perform
her
walk
of
atonement
before
the
day
of
her
trial
and
they
both
agree
this
cannot
happen
However
at
the
Standoff
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
House
Tyrell
and
Jaime
Lannister
try
to
revert
it
The
High
Sparrow
then
concludes
that
Margaery
is
ultimately
spared
from
her
walk
as
she
is
already
repented
for
her
crimes
due
to
uncovering
House
Lannisters
treachery
against
the
sparrows
Tommen
then
agrees
to
an
alliance
with
the
High
Sparrow
symbolizing
the
union
of
the
crown
and
the
faith
When
Jaime
Lannister
is
formally
removed
from
the
Kingsguard
for
threatening
the
Faith
he
sarcastically
asks
if
he
will
be
forced
to
make
a
walk
of
atonement
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
it
seems
that
walks
of
atonement
are
civil
punishments
used
to
publicly
shame
women
accused
of
adultery
or
prostitution
It
also
serves
as
a
means
of
degrading
these
women
and
stripping
them
of
whatever
pride
or
power
they
might
hold
The
novels
mention
only
two
people
who
had
to
go
through
this
humiliating
punishment
Tytos
Lannisters
mistress
and
Cersei
Tywin
Lannister
forced
his
fathers
mistress
to
make
a
walk
of
atonement
after
Lord
Tytos
died
While
it
is
common
for
widowed
lords
to
take
lowborn
women
as
bedwarmers
Tytoss
mistress
a
woman
scarcely
one
step
above
a
prostitute
had
come
to
dominate
him
utterly
she
was
seated
beside
him
in
the
hall
showered
with
gifts
and
honors
and
even
asked
for
her
views
on
matters
of
state
She
stole
from
him
issued
orders
to
the
household
knights
dismissed
servants
and
helped
herself
to
the
jewelry
of
the
late
Lady
Jeyne
Tytoss
wife
She
grew
so
influential
that
it
was
said
around
Lannisport
that
any
man
who
wished
for
his
petition
to
be
heard
should
kneel
before
her
and
speak
loudly
to
her
lap
for
Lord
Tytoss
ear
was
between
his
ladys
legs
Lord
Tytos
died
of
a
heart
attack
while
climbing
stairs
to
his
mistress
and
the
first
thing
Tywin
did
on
his
return
from
Kings
Landing
was
to
expel
her
from
Casterly
Rock
All
the
selfseekers
who
had
named
themselves
her
friends
and
cultivated
her
favor
abandoned
her
The
silks
and
velvets
Tytos
had
lavished
on
her
were
taken
away
as
was
the
jewelry
she
had
appropriated
Tywin
had
her
stripped
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Lannisport
to
the
docks
for
a
fortnight
telling
everyone
she
met
that
she
was
a
thief
and
a
whore
Though
no
man
laid
a
hand
on
her
that
walk
spelled
the
end
of
her
power
Cersei
was
too
young
to
witness
the
spectacle
herself
but
heard
the
stories
from
washerwomen
and
guardsmen
who
had
been
there
Although
Cerseis
uncle
Kevan
Lannister
disapproved
of
many
of
her
deeds
her
incestuous
affair
with
Jaime
corrupting
Lancel
spoiling
Joffrey
and
her
poor
conduct
as
the
Queen
Regent
he
does
not
gloat
at
Cersei
but
feels
sorry
for
her
public
humiliation
He
muses
sadly
that
Tywin
would
have
never
dreamed
that
the
same
degrading
punishment
he
gave
their
fathers
mistress
would
be
imposed
on
his
own
daughter
In
the
novels
when
Cersei
is
shorn
the
septas
remove
all
of
her
body
hair
her
eyebrows
pubic
hair
even
scraping
the
rest
of
her
body
They
shave
her
head
completely
bald
In
the
TV
episode
the
septas
prominently
produce
a
razor
blade
as
if
they
are
going
to
shave
her
but
curiously
does
not
use
it
at
all
One
septa
separately
picks
up
a
pair
of
shears
and
cuts
Cerseis
luxurious
long
golden
hair
off
but
crops
it
close
to
her
head
instead
of
shaving
her
bald
entirely
In
her
subsequent
nude
scenes
the
rest
of
her
body
hair
isnt
shaved
While
Cersei
performs
the
walk
of
atonement
she
hallucinates
many
characters
most
of
them
are
long
dead

the
crowd

prophecy
about
another
queen
who
will
cast
Cersei
down
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
Cerseis
walk
of
atonement
is
loosely
based
on
what
happened
to
Jane
Shore
the
mistress
of
King
Edward
IV
of
England
Like
Robert
Baratheon
Edward
was
a
great
warrior
who
won
the
crown
on
the
battlefield
in
his
youth
but
became
fat
and
illsuited
to
rule
in
later
life
After
Edward
died
his
brother
Richard
III
usurped
the
throne
ahead
of
Edwards
sons
He
deeply
resented
Jane
so
he
had
her
arrested
and
made
her
perform
a
penance
walk
a
common
punishment
for
harlotry
Jane
did
not
perform
the
penance
walk
naked
however
but
had
to
walk
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
London
wearing
only
her
kirtle
petticoat
which
at
the
time
was
still
said
to
have
gained
significant
male
attention
the
main
source
of
the
humiliation
was
that
this
was
a
punishment
normally
meted
out
to
harlots
Martin
has
said
that
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
one
of
the
major
inspirations
for
his
novels
the
conflict
was
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
while
in
Westeros
the
conflict
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
clearly
named
after
the
real
families

History
Background
House
Greyjoy
is
one
of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros
Their
lands
are
the
Iron
Islands
off
the
west
coast
of
the
continent
They
rule
from
their
castle
Pyke
from
the
island
of
the
same
name
The
Iron
Islands
are
harsh
and
bleak
and
the
Greyjoys
have
traditionally
survived
by
raiding
their
neighbors
They
have
always
had
plans
to
conquer
the
mainland
The
head
of
the
house
is
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke
House
Greyjoy
boasts
descent
from
the
Grey
King
a
legendary
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
said
to
have
ruled
for
a
thousand
years
and
taken
a
mermaid
as
his
wife
Like
the
vast
majority
of
ironborn
they
worship
theDrowned
God
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
was
the
founder
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
Iron
Islands
He
led
a
rebellion
against
King
Robert
Baratheon
eight
years
before
the
events
of
the
series
begin
Balons
sons
Rodrik
and
Maron
were
killed
in
the
unsuccessful
rebellion
Balons
only
surviving
son
Theon
was
made
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
to
ensure
Balons
submission
to
King
Robert
Only
his
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
and
two
of
his
brothers
remained
on
the
Iron
Islands
after
his
defeat
At
some
point
Balon
exiled
his
younger
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
who
became
a
feared
pirate
that
terrorized
the
seas
as
far
as
from
Oldtown
in
Westeros
to
Qarth
in
Essos
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
is
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
He
lives
at
the
Stark
castle
of
Winterfell
where
he
has
a
cordial
relationship
with
his
Stark
hosts
Despite
the
respectful
treatment
accorded
by
the
Starks
Theon
is
insecure
about
his
status
as
a
ward
He
boasts
of
his
status
as
a
lord
to
Osha
a
Wildling
servant
in
the
Stark
household
but
fails
to
intimidate
her
He
later
accompanies
Neds
son
Robb
Stark
the
King
in
the
North
to
fight
in
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
and
wins
Robbs
trust
and
favor
Season
Theon
appeals
to
King
Robb
to
send
him
on
a
mission
to
negotiate
an
alliance
with
his
father
Balon
Greyjoy
reasoning
that
the
Starks
would
need
ships
to
attack
Kings
Landing
Despite
Catelyn
Starks
distrust
of
Balon
Robb
relents
and
sends
Theon
back
to
the
Iron
Islands
to
secure
help
However
Balon
has
other
ideas
and
plans
to
use
the

struggle
on
the
mainland
to
carve
up
a
kingdom
in
the
North
once
more
declaring
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
is
torn
between
his
birth
family
and
his
loyalty
to
the
Starks
but
ultimately
chooses
to
submit
to
his
father
Theon
decides
to
renege
his
allegiance
to
the
Starks
and
is
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Drowned
God
while
his
father
and
sister
watch
on
Balons
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
leads
a
large
force
that
attacks
Deepwood
Motte
the
seat
of
House
Glover
Meanwhile
Theon
is
made
the
commander
of
the
Sea
Bitch
Instead
of
attacking
small
fishing
villages
as
ordered
Theon
and
his
men
raid
Torrhens
Square
and
succeed
in
drawing
the
remaining
Stark
forces
away
from
Winterfell
Without
consulting
Balon
or
Yara
Theon
and
his
men
seize
Winterfell
and
capture
Neds
younger
sons
Bran
and
Rickon
Stark
Theon
also
executes
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
for
defying
him
However
the
two
Stark
boys
and
their
Direwolves
escape
with
the
help
of
Osha
and
Hodor
In
retaliation
Theon
murders
two
orphans
and
claims
them
as
Bran
and
Rickon
His
actions
have
the
effect
of
fuelling
northern
hostility
towards
the
Ironborn
invaders
Balon
and
Yara
are
furious
with
Theons
conduct
which
has
jeopardized
the
Ironborn
war
effort
Yara
leads
a
party
to
implore
her
brother
to
leave
Winterfell
Theon
refuses
and
insists
on
defending
his
prize
against
the
northerners
Unable
to
reason
with
Theon
Yara
is
forced
to
leave
him
behind
Theon
and
his
paltry
garrison
are
besieged
by
a
large
Bolton
army
led
by
Ramsay
Snow
the
bastard
son
of
Roose
Bolton
a
vassal
of
the
Starks
The
Ironborn
turn
on
Theon
and
hand
him
over
to
Ramsay
in
return
for
safe
conduct
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
flays
them
alive
The
capture
of
Theon
is
a
major
blow
to
House
Greyjoy
since
it
deprives
Balon
of
his
last
remaining
son
and
heir
to
the
Seastone
Chair
Season
Over
a
prolonged
period
Theon
Greyjoy
is
tortured
and
emasculated
by
Ramsay
Snow
Due
to
his
experiences
Theon
adopts
the
persona
Reek
and
becomes
totally
subjugated
to
Ramsay
Theon
later
issues
an
ultimatum
to
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
demanding
that
he
withdraw
his
forces
from
the
North
Ramsay
also
threatens
to
send
more
bits
of
his
son
Theon
and
to
flay
every
Ironborn
in
the
North
alive
if
his
demands
are
not
met
As
a
parting
gift
Ramsay
also
presents
Theons
severed
penis
Unwilling
to
abandon
the
strongholds
he
has
taken
Balon
rejects
Ramsays
demands
He
also
rejects
his
son
Theon
because
he
disobeyed
his
orders
and
cannot
produce
heirs
to
further
the
Greyjoy
line
Defying
her
fathers
wishes
Yara
assembles
a
team
of
Ironborn
warriors
to
rescue
her
brother
Theon
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
has
seemingly
forgotten
his
former
identity
and
embraced
the
persona
Reek
He
is
totally
subservient
to
his
master
Ramsay
Upon
returning
to
the
Dreadfort
Roose
Bolton
reprimands
his
son
Ramsay
for
torturing
and
emasculating
Theon
As
Balons
son
and
heir
he
would
have
been
a
valuable
hostage
for
him
to
trade
with
Balon
in
return
for
securing
the
withdrawal
of
Ironborn
forces
from
the
North
Later
Yara
and
her
warriors
manage
to
infiltrate
the
Dreadfort
and
reach
Theons
cell
However
fearing
that
it
is
another
trap
set
up
by
his
master
Theon
spurns
Yaras
offer
Yara
and
her
warriors
are
forced
to
flee
when
Ramsay
unleashes
his
dogs
on
them
After
reaching
their
boats
Yara
regards
her
brother
Theon
to
be
dead
Having
proven
his
loyalty
Reek
is
sent
on
a
mission
by
Ramsay
to
secure
the
surrender
of
the
Ironborn
garrison
at
Moat
Cailin
For
this
mission
Reek
has
to
pretend
to
be
Theon
Identifying
himself
as
Theon
and
Balons
last
remaining
heir
Reek
addresses
the
Ironborn
garrison
telling
them
to
surrender
in
return
for
safe
passage
Despite
being
met
by
resistance
from
the
garrison
commander
Ralf
Kenning
his
men
accept
Theons
offer
and
surrender
to
the
Boltons
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
has
them
flayed
alive
anyway
Season
In
an
attempt
to
reach
out
to
Theon
Sansa
Stark
reminds
him
of
his
real
name
and
position
as
Balons
only
surviving
son
and
heir
Ultimately
Theon
sheds
his
Reek
persona
and
helps
Sansa
to
escape
the
new
Bolton
stronghold
of
Winterfell
Season
After
being
rescued
from
Bolton
hunters
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
and
Podrick
Payne
Theon
decides
to
part
company
with
Sansa
and
her
companions
because
he
fears
retribution
from
Jon
Snow
for
his
role
in
the
disappearance
of
Bran
and
Rickon
and
the
murder
of
the
two
orphans
Theon
takes
one
horse
and
travels
towards
the
Iron
Islands
Meanwhile
the
Greyjoys
face
another
major
setback
with
the

With
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
over
the
northern
lords

returning
to
the

and
pushing
back
the
Ironborn
gains
Yara
Greyjoy
counsels
her
father
Balon
to
end
his
campaign
to
conquer
the
North
but
he
refuses

her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
announces
that
a
kingsmoot
will
elect
the
new
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
finally
returns
to
Pyke
and
receives
a
cold
reception
from
his
sister
Yara
who
is
still
angry
at
him
for
spurning
her
rescue
attempt
at
the
Dreadfort
though
her
mood
picks
up
when
Theon
pledges
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
able
to
win
the
support
of
many

her
reputation
as
a
warrior
and
Theons
support
Yara
promises
to
build
a
mighty
fleet

Overview
The
main
characters
are
from
House
Forrester
The
Forresters
are
a
family
of
the
minor
nobility
from
the
Wolfswood
in
the
North
bannermen
to
House
Glover
who
are
in
turn
themselves
major
vassals
sworn
to
House
Stark
of
Winterfell
The
seat
of
House
Forrester
is
Ironrath
an
imposing
stronghold
in
the
forest
surrounded
by
ironwood
trees
Their
House
words
are
Iron
from
Ice
echoing
their
belief
that
the
severe
cold
and
hostile
landscape
of
the
North
only
make
them
stronger
House
Forrester
does
actually
exist
in
the
novels
and
they
are
a
minor
House
in
the
Wolfswood
who
serve
as
vassals
to
House
Glover
However
they
were
only
mentioned
in
passing
once
and
its
current
members
were
not
described
guides
Lady
Sybell
Glover
had
given
them
trackers
and
hunters
sworn
to
Deepwood
with
clan
names
like
Forrester
and
Woods
Branch
and
Bole
A
Dance
With
Dragons
Chapter
With
no
details
given
about
its
current
members
in
the
novels
this
gives
the
video
game
a
blank
canvas
to
fill
new
characters
with
The
events
in
the
game
series
generally
coincide
with
Season
beginning
towards
the
end
of
Season
and
ending
just
before
Season
begins
Players
will
visit
familiar
locations
such
as
Kings
Landing
and
the
Wall
as
well
as
unfamiliar
locations
such
as
Ironrath
the
home
of
House
Forrester
The
game
will
be
played
from
five
different
points
of
view
Each
character
you
play
as
is
a
member
of
House
Forrester
either
a
direct
family
member
or
a
person
in
service
to
the
House
Scattered
across
Westeros
and
Essos
each
character
will
play
their
part
in
seeking
to
save
House
Forrester
from
destruction
Playing
as
five
characters
not
only
reflects
the
epic
scope
of
Game
of
Thrones
but
is
also
something
that
the
player
needs
to
be
mindful
of
This
is
because
the
actions
of
one
character
can
ripple
out
to
affect
the
rest
of
House
Forrester
Actors
from
the
main
Game
of
Thrones
TV
series
will
reprise
their
roles
for
the
video
game
providing
voiceacting
for
the
ingame
appearances
of
their
characters
including
Lena
Headey
Cersei
Peter
Dinklage
Tyrion
Natalie
Dormer
Margaery
and
Iwan
Rheon
Ramsay
Other
actors
and
characters
from
the
main
TV
series
will

in
later
episodes
Background
In
the
social
structure
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
there
are
usually
only
nine
Great
Houses
such
as
the
Starks
or
Lannisters
that
rule
entire
regions
seven
kingdoms
plus
the
Riverlands
which
are
a
borderland
region
plus
the
capital
region
of
the
Crownlands
Each
Great
House
has
about
a
dozen
or
so
major
noble
Houses
immediately
sworn
to
them
In
the
North
these
include
House
Umber
House
Manderly
House
Karstark
and
House
Glover
among
others
All
told
this
means
that
there
are
a
little
over
one
hundred
major
noble
Houses
in
Westeros
almost
all
of
which
have
been
accounted
for
in
the
novels
However
each
of
the
major
noble
Houses
also
have
their
own
minor
noble
Houses
that
serve
them
as
local
bannermen
For
example
House
Cassel
is
a
local
minor
House
in
direct
service
to
the
Starks
not
one
of
the
major
noble
Houses
like
the
Umbers
George
RR
Martin
has
said
that
in
retrospect
he
should
have
used
distinct
terms
for
the
three
different
ranks
of
nobles
such
as
duke
and
baron
instead
of
each
holding
the
rank
of
Lord
Given
that
each
major
noble
House
has
a
couple
of
minor
Houses
serving
as
local
bannermen
there
are
apparently
hundreds
of
minor
Houses
which
have
never
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
with
the
main
novel
mostly
focusing
on
the
largescale
conflicts
between
entire
kingdoms
Essentially
the
video
game
is
focusing
on
a
representative
everyman
minor
House
to
show
how
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
is
impacting
people
on
a
local
level
Westeros
is
a
large
continent
often
said
to
be
roughly
the
size
of
South
America
not
simply
one
country
so
the
unified
realm
under
the
Iron
Throne
is
on
the
scale
of
the
Roman
Empire
and
each
constituent
kingdom
such
as
the
North
is
the
size
of
an
entire
reallife
medieval
country
with
armies
numbering
in
the
tens
of
thousands
Major
Houses
such
as
the
Umbers
or
Karstarks
can
raise
armies
from
their
combined
minor
bannermen
numbering
in
the
low
thousands
Minor
noble
Houses
who
are
bannermen
to
the
others
have
forces
numbering
in
the
hundreds

most

it
and
then
uses
it
on
a
loose
stone
at
the
bottom
hinge
of
the
door
Cotter
will
show
up
to
help
break
through
the
rock
and
the
two
make
their
escape
After
avoiding
being
spotted
by
a
guard
Finn
will
show
up
and
ask
to
join
Gared
and
Cotter
in
their
escape
north
of
the
Wall
Cotter
does
not
want
Finn
to
go
with
them
but
the
decision
is
ultimately
up
to
Gared
If
Gared
chooses
to
bring
Finn
he
will
join
Gared
and
Cotter
Gared
can
still
allow
Finn
to
join
after
initially
choosing
to
leave
Finn
behind
but
hell
angrily
stay
behind
if
Gared
tells
Finn
that
his
mind
is
made
up
If
Gared
was
not
on
good
terms
with
him
Finn
will
not
be
encountered
Cutter
will
say
he
managed
to
avoid
him
and
Gared
automatically
leaves
without
him
Across
the
Narrow
Sea
Asher
Forrester
Beskha
and
Malcolm
Branfield
are
brought
before
Daenerys
Targaryen
Daenerys
warns
the
group
that
as
their
Mother
she
doesnt
tolerate
lies
about
her
dragons
Viserion
flies
into
the
tent
and
Daenerys
dares
Asher
to
try
and
touch
him
If
Asher
tries
to
pet
Viserion
Daenerys
will
appreciate
Ashers
bravery
but
it
wont
affect
the
outcome
When
Daenerys
asks
for
proof
of
Ashers
encounter
with
Drogon
Asher
will
give
her
the
dragon
tooth
Daenerys
will
become
defensive
and
concerned
about
Drogon
attacking
people
She
denies
Ashers
request
to
borrow
some
sellswords
When
it
is
revealed
that
Beskha
has
been
to
Meereen
before
Daenerys
insists
that
they
must
help
the
fight
in
Meereen
if
they
want
her
help
Regardless
of
whether
Asher
or
his
uncle
volunteers
Beskha
she
will
be
incredibly
angry
at
having
to
take
part
in
the
mission
Asher
later
finds
Beskha
drinking
and
in
an
even
worse
state
Croft
scolds
Beskha
for
her
behavior
and
they
begin
to
fight
Asher
can
break
up
the
fight
or
take
a
side
but
the
outcome
is
the
same
regardless
and
Beskha
then
attacks
Asher
If
Asher
chooses
not
to
fight
back
he
will
still
be
unharmed
If
he
chooses
to
fight
Beskha
will
be
relatively
undamaged
Regardless
Beskha
will
finally
admit
why
Meereen
has
been
bugging
her
all
this
time
Beskha
used
to
be
a
slave
to
one
of
the
Great
Masters
of
Meereen
She
was
kidnapped
as
a
toddler
and
sold
into
slavery
She
was
eventually
thrown
into
the
fighting
pits
and
forced
to
fight
other
slave
children
While
she
talks
Asher
can
get
her
another
drink
Otherwise
shell
get
one
herself
She
tells
Asher
that
she
knows
Meereen
well
but
she
also
fears
it
Asher
Beskha
and
the
rest
of
Daeneryss
men
prepare
for
the
attack
on
Meereen
While
the
slaves
are
being
armed
and
prepare
for
the
uprising
Asher
and
his
group
will
seize
the
eastern
beacon
before
they
have
the
chance
to
warn
the
Great
Masters
of
the
coming
attack
and
slave
rebellion
Asher
is
ordered
to
follow
Crofts
every
direction
or
he
will
not
receive
any
reward
Led
by
Beskha
Asher
and
Croft
sneak
around
through
Meereens
alleys
to
avoid
the
guards
gaze
As
Asher
scouts
the
area
a
slave
is
discovered
and
brought
out
into
the
street
to
be
beaten
After
the
guards
leave
Beskha
goes
to
the
slaves
side
to
help
his
passing
Enraged
at
the
slaves
death
Beskha
runs
off
down
another
alley
Asher
and
Croft
follow
her
and
find
her
pulling
a
Great
Master
out
of
his
house
and
beating
him
to
the
ground
She
reveals
him
to
be
her
former
slave
master
Dezhor
zo
Raza
She
is
intent
on
taking
her
revenge
but
this
goes
against
the
orders
of
both
Daenerys
and
Croft
Asher
either
kills
Dezhor
zo
Raza
himself
stops
Croft
and
allows
Beskha
to
kill
her
former
master
or
stops
Beskha
from
killing
Dezhor
zo
Raza
Regardless
of
Ashers
decision
the
group
leaves
to
take
care
of
the
beacon
Asher
Beskha
and
Croft
reach
the
beacon
and
need
to
carefully
take
out
each
guard
they
encounter
After
slaughtering
a
number
of
guards
a
few
spot
the
group
and
try
to
light
the
beacon
Asher
manages
to
kill
the
one
last
guard
trying
to
light
the
beacon
the
attack
is
successful
and
the
way
is
prepared
for
the
coming
revolt
At
Ironrath
With
Gryff
Whitehill
as
the
new
Lord
of
Ironrath
Lord
Rodrik
Forrester
is
forced
to
train
in
secret
with
Ser
Royland
Degore
in
the
Ironwood
Grove
At
first
Rodrik
doesnt
do
well
but
Royland
teaches
Rodrik
a
trick
hitting
an
opponent
behind
the
knees
and
helping
Rodrik
win
a
fight
despite
his
injured
leg
After
the
training
Elaena
Glenmore
will
show
up
with
her
younger
brother
Arthur
Regardless
of
whether
Elaena
agreed
to
wed
Rodrik
Elaena
reveals
that
Lord
Ludd
Whitehill
has
strongarmed
her
father
into
forcing
her
to
marry
Gryff
instead
Elaena
is
displeased
with
this
situation
and
refuses
to
marry
Gryff
She
requests
that
Rodrik
help
her
get
rid
of
Gryff
If
Rodrik
agrees
Arthur
will
loan
House
Glenmores
elite
guard
to
House
Forrester
As
Rodrik
and
Elaena
prepare
for
their
attack
on
the
Whitehills
they
hear
that
Gryff
has
attacked
Maester
Ortengryn
The
guard
who
Talia
Forrester
bit
has
had
his
wound
become
infected
and
Gryff
accuses
the
maester
of
deliberately
allowing
the
wound
to
fester
The
Glenmore
soldiers
prepare
to
ambush
the
Great
Hall
as
Rodrik
and
Elaena
enter
to
find
Gryff
beating
the
maester
Gryff
will
be
surprised
to
see
Elaena
and
threatens
her
Rodrik
toys
with
Gryff
and
then
summons
the
Glenmore
men
when
hes
ready
The
Glenmore
soldiers
surround
Gryff
and
his
men
Rodrik
can
show
Gryff
mercy
by
not
hitting
him
or
only
hitting
Gryff
once
or
twice
and
stopping
before
he
takes
any
serious
injury
Rodrik
can
also
beat
Gryff
to
a
pulp
He
cant
actually
kill
Gryff
but
Rodrik
can
maim
Gryffs
left
eye
and
knock
Gryff
out
Regardless
of
what
Rodrik
does
with
Gryff
Lady
Elissa
Forrester
insists
that
word
must
not
reach
Lord
Whitehill
and
demands
that
all
of
Ironraths
ravens
be
killed
With
the
Glenmore
men
to
secure
the
keep
Ironrath
is
finally
back
under
the
control
of
House
Forrester
Talia
and
Lady
Forrester
will
comment
on
what
Rodrik
did
to
Gryff
Then
a
message
is
received
from
Highpoint
Lord
Whitehill
has
extended
an
invitation
to
discuss
a
truce
With
Gryff
now
in
Forrester
custody
House
Forrester
can
bargain
for
Ryon
Forrester
Rodrik
will
be
walking
into
dangerous
territory
but
he
could
have
some
extra
protection
if
the
Glenmores
came
with
him
Ser
Royland
will
advise
bringing
the
Glenmore
soldiers
to
Highpoint
as
protection
while
Duncan
Tuttle
will
advise
leaving
the
Glenmore
soldiers
to
guard
Ironrath
After
Rodrik
has
decided
what
to
do
with
the
Glenmore
soldiers
he
needs
to
choose
whether
to
bring
Duncan
or
Ser
Royland
with
him
to
Highpoint
Rodriks
final
decision
before
he
leaves
is
to
give
Talia
a
task
At
Kings
Landing
Whispers
fill
the
hallways
of
Kings
Landing
on
the
day
of
Tommens
coronation
and
Mira
Forrester
listens
closely
to
what
is
being
said
Mira
meets
with
the
coal
boy
Tom
Tom
confirms
that
Lord
Ludd
Whitehill
is
sending
lots
of
gold
to
someone
in
Kings
Landing
Mira
has
two
suspects
the
ironwood
merchants
Lord
Morgryn
and
Lord
Andros
She
decides
to
investigate
by
sneaking
into
King
Tommens
coronation
feast
Despite
being
uninvited
Mira
shows
up
to
the
feast
She
finds
Sera
Durwell
who
agrees
to
help
her
sneak
into
the
party
Lord
Garibald
Tarwick
will
approach
the
ladies
and
is
formally
introduced
to
Mira
He
has
a
short
conversation
with
them
Lord
Tarwick
and
Sera
will
then
leave
Mira
freeing
her
to
explore
the
feast
Mira
can
eavesdrop
on
various
partygoers
After
eavesdropping
on
Lord
Andros
Mira
can
talk
with
Lord
Morgryn
to
reveal
that
Lord
Andros
has
pushed
Lord
Morgryn
out
of
the
ironwood
business
and
Lord
Whitehill
now
works
exclusively
with
Lord
Andros
Lyman
Lannister
a
distant
third
cousin
to
the
main
line
has
taken
Lord
Morgryns
place
and
fulfills
Morgryns
role
in
Lord
Andross
ironwood
deal
Mira
tries
to
talk
with
Lyman
but
Lord
Andros
yells
at
him
to
stop
talking
with
her
Lady
Margaery
Tyrell
will
show
up
to
the
feast
but
thankfully
Sera
hides
Mira
from
her
line
of
sight
While
Sera
attends
to
Lady
Margaery
Lord
Tarwick
will
check
on
Mira
and
warn
her
about
Lyman
When
Mira
needs
answers
about
why
Lyman
is
dangerous
Lord
Tarwick
asks
Mira
for
the
truth
about
the
identity
of
Seras
family
because
the
last
Durwells
supposedly
died
out
over
two
centuries
ago
If
Mira
vouches
for
Seras
family
and
lies
that
House
Durwell
survives
as
a
small
unnoticed
family
then
Lord
Tarwick
will
decide
to
propose
to
Sera
If
Mira
reveals
the
truth
that
Sera
is
a
bastard
Lord
Tarwick
will
end
his
courtship
of
Sera
Regardless
of
how
Mira
answers
his
question
Lord
Tarwick
will
reveal
that
Lyman
suffered
a
head
wound
at
a
tournament
and
has
been
addicted
to
milk
of
the
poppy
ever
since
Mira
uses
this
information
to
coax
information
out
of
Lyman
and
he
reveals
that
Lord
Andros
is
using
the
gold
from
Lord
Whitehill
to
hire
hundreds
of
sellswords
to
destroy
the
Forresters
North
of
the
Wall
Gared
Cotter
and
Finn
if
Gared
chose
to
bring
him
along
argue
as
they
wander
Beyond
the
Wall
They
see
a
wildling
and
Cotter
decides
to
go
and
talk
with
her
hoping
that
shell
trust
him
However
since
Cotter
is
still
wearing
his
Nights
Watch
cloak
the
wildling
doesnt
trust
the
Crow
Gared
and
his
group
will
end
up
being
surrounded
by
wildlings
Regardless
of
whether
Gared
chooses
to
stay
hidden
or
attack
they
will
have
to
fight
the
wildlings
Cotter
will
be
injured
but
he
assures
Gared
that
they
can
rest
up
ahead
Gared
and
his
group
arrive
at
a
small
wildling
camp
Cotter
says
its
abandoned
and
asks
Gared
to
fetch
him
something
to
drink
Gared
goes
into
a
tent
in
the
back
to
investigate
but
a
youngwildling
girl
comes
up
behind
Gared
and
threatens
to
kill
him
As
Gared
tries
to
talk
her
down
Cotter
comes
to
investigate
Cotter
recognizes
her
as
his
little
sister
Sylvi
and
hugs
her
At
Highpoint
Gwyn
Whitehill
greets
Lord
Rodrik
Forrester
and
his
company
and
welcomes
them
to
Highpoint
Gwyn
will
question
Rodriks
intentions
as
they
walk
to
the
dining
hall
If
the
Glenmore
soldiers
were
brought
they
will
follow
Rodrik
through
Highpoint
Shell
mention
that
she
kept
her
promise
of
pushing
for
peace
citing
the
invitation
as
proof
They
stop
at
a
tapestry
depicting
the
Whitehill
family
When
you
get
to
the
hall
Gwyn
will
go
off
to
get
her
father
leaving
Rodrik
his
mother
his
advisor
and
possibly
the
Glenmore
soldiers
locked
inside
with
Whitehill
crossbowmen
aiming
at
them
from
above
Rodrik
can
talk
with
his
group
as
he
searches
for
an
exit
After
Rodrik
has
looked
around
the
room
Gwyn
will
return
with
Lord
Ludd
Whitehill
and
the
meeting
will
begin
Lord
Whitehill
begins
with
small
talk
and
makes
a
toast
After
the
toast
he
finally
makes
his
proposal
House
Whitehill
will
continue
to
harvest
the
ironwood
but
will
allow
House
Forrester
to
work
under
the
Whitehills
to
make
more
weapons
for
House
Bolton
and
share
in
the
profit
at
a
much
smaller
percentage
Rodrik
and
Lady
Forrester
refuse
so
Lord
Whitehill
threatens
to
order
Gryff
Whitehill
to
burn
Ironrath
to
the
ground
Rodrik
then
reveals
that
Gryff
has
been
imprisoned
and
offers
to
trade
Gryff
for
Ryon
Forrester
Lord
Whitehill
responds
by
bringing
in
Ryon
and
threatening
to
kill
him
unless
Rodrik
gives
in
Even
if
Rodrik
threatens
to
kill
Gryff
Lord
Whitehill
wont
budge
and
claims
not
to
care
about
his
fourthborn
son
Rodrik
can
accept
Lord
Whitehills
ironwood
deal
on
the
condition
that
Lord
Whitehill
follow
through
on
a
trade
of
Gryff
for
Ryon
Rodrik
can
also
call
Lord
Whitehills
bluff
that
he
isnt
willing
to
risk
sacrificing
Gryff
If
Rodrik
begs
for
mercy
Lord
Whitehill
will
spare
Ryon
Regardless
of
Rodriks
choice
Lord
Whitehill
is
willing
to
trade
Gryff
for
Ryon
When
Rodrik
and
his
group
return
to
Ironrath
everyone
is
missing
including
the
Glenmore
troops
if
Rodrik
chose
to
leave
them
at
Ironrath
If
the
Glenmore
troops
were
brought
along
to
Highpoint
two
of
them
will
walk
alongside
Rodrik
as
he
enters
Ironrath
If
they
were
left
Rodrik
will
find
an
arrow
and
drops
of
blood
After
hearing
a
laugh
inside
the
hall
Rodrik
enters
to
find
Ramsay
Snow
talking
and
eating
with
Talia

Summary
In
the
Crownlands
Lord
Eddard
Stark
wakes
up
after
a
long
period
of
unconsciousness
due
to
the
injuries
inflicted
on
him
by
Jaime
Lannisters
men
He
finds
both
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
Queen
Cersei
waiting
King
Roberts
hunting
party
Cersei
is
furious
with
Eddards
acts
in
having
her
brother
Tyrion
arrested
and
attacking
Jaime
in
the
street
She
wants
Robert
to
take
action
against
him
but
Robert
refuses
to
condemn
him
without
hearing
Eddards
side
and
tells
her
to
be
silent
When
Cersei
protests
further
and
calls
Robert
a
woman
he
hits
her
She
says
that
she
will
wear
the
bruise
with
honor
He
tells
her
to
be
silent
or
he
will
honor
her
again
and
Cersei
leaves
in
anger
Afterwards
Robert
restores
Eddard
to
his
position
as
Kings
Hand
and
tells
him
not
to
quit
again
or
he
will
give
the
position
to
Jaime
Lannister
He
tells
Lord
Eddard
to
end
the
animosity
between
House
Stark
and
House
Lannister
as
strife
between
these
two
powerful
houses
could
lead
them
into
war
He
is
leaving
on
a
hunt
and
wants
the
realm
at
peace
by
the
time
he
returns
Arya
has
another
dancing
lesson
with
Syrio
Forel
but
isnt
in
the
mood
due
to
Jorys
death
Syrio
tells
her
that
she
may
need
to
fight
at
any
time
not
just
when
shes
in
the
mood
He
wisely
reminds
her
that
being
prepared
to
fight
is
more
important
in
times
of
sadness
than
in
peaceful
times
of
happiness
King
Robert
is
out
hunting
accompanied
by
his
brother
Renly
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
and
Lancel
Lannister
Robert
being
supplied
with
wine
by
Lancel
becomes
drunk
and
nostalgic
longing
for
the
days
of
young
knights
trying
to
make
a
name
for
themselves
and
when
enemies
stood
openly
in
opposition
instead
of
being
hidden
schemers
Robert
brags
about
all
the
women
he
has
bedded
but
Renly
becomes
irate
when
he
begins
to
question
him
about
his
history
with
women
Renly
calls
him
a
fool
and
remarks
that
the
past
had
its
share
of
violence
that
Robert
is
conveniently
ignoring
Renly
storms
off
leaving
Ser
Barristan
to
look
on
concerned
as
Lancel
keeps
up
King
Roberts
wine
supply
In
Kings
Landing
at
a
meeting
of
the
small
council
a
group
of
refugees
come
to
tell
of
how
their
villages
have
been
destroyed
Eddard
hears
tales
of
a
huge
knight
ravaging
the
Riverlands
He
realizes
that
its
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
The
Mountain
who
is
likely
under
Lannister
orders
to
punish
the
Riverlands
which
are
held
by
House
Tully
the
former
House
of
his
wife
Catelyn
who
now
holds
Tyrion
captive
Even
though
King
Robert
told
him
to
make
peace
with
the
Lannisters
Lord
Eddard
could
not
bring
himself
to
let
this
injustice
stand
Eddard
strips
Gregor
Clegane
of
his
knighthood
land
and
titles
and
sends
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion
with
a
retinue
of
one
hundred
knights
to
arrest
and
execute
him
in
the
kings
name
Eddard
discovers
the
secret
Jon
Arryn
died
for
He
also
orders
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
send
word
to
Casterly
Rock
demanding
Lord
Tywin
Lannisters
presence
in
court
to
explain
his
bannermans
actions
or
be
branded
an
enemy
of
the
crown
and
a
traitor
to
the
realm
Littlefinger
Petyr
Baelish
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
are
both
concerned
with
the
harshness
of
these
orders
and
Eddards
actions
against
the
Lannisters
but
Eddard
wants
to
see
justice
done
Prince
Joffrey
comes
to
apologize
to
Sansa
for
the
incident
on
the
Kingsroad
He
calls
her
his
lady
love
and
gives
her
a
necklace
Sansa
forgives
him
and
they
seem
reconciled
Sansa
is
unaware
that
the
Queen
put
Joffrey
up
to
the
apology
some
time
ago
Eddard
decides
to
send
his
daughters
back
to
Winterfell
Arya
is
worried
that
she
must
leave
Syrio
Sansa
protests
that
no
one
cares
about
her
trivial
dancing
instructor
they
are
talking
about
breaking
her
betrothal
to
Joffrey
Lord
Eddard
says
that
he
will
find
someone
else
for
her
Sansa
refusesshe
is
going
to
marry
Joffrey
and
have
lots
of
goldenhaired
babies
This
gives
Eddard
pause
and
sends
him
back
to
the
book
that
Jon
Arryn
was
looking
at
before
he
died
Consulting
the
books
entry
on
House
Baratheon
Lord
Eddard
finds
that
every
time
a
Baratheon
has
married
the
children
have
had
black
hairright
up
to
Cersei
and
Roberts
children
who
are
all
blond
In
the
North
Stiv
and
Osha
accost
Bran
near
Winterfell
In
Winterfell
Bran
has
another
dream
about
the
ThreeEyed
Raven
in
which
it
flies
into
the
castles
crypts
He
wakes
up
to
find
that
Hodor
has
brought
the
finished
saddle
designed
by
Tyrion
He
goes
on
a
ride
with
Robb
and
Theon
They
have
had
word
from
Kings
Landing
about
Eddards
injury
Jorys
death
and
Tyrions
capture
Theon
thinks
that
Robb
should
prepare
the
North
for
war
but
Robb
is
determined
to
make
his
own
decision
for
when
that
time
has
come
and
until
then
will
follow
his
parents
orders
to
remain
in
Winterfell
Theydiscover
that
Bran
has
wandered
off
on
his
horse
and
go
looking
for
him
Robb
finds
a
group
of
wildlingsthreatening
Bran
and
trying
to
steal
his
horse
Robb
kills
two
but
another
wildling
holds
Bran
with
a
knife
to
the
throat
Theon
shoots
him
from
behind
angering
Robb
by
endangering
Bran
The
remaining
wildling
a
woman
named
Osha
yields
and
begs
for
her
life
Robb
agrees
to
take
her
as
a
prisoner
Theon
tells
Ros
he
will
miss
her
as
she
leaves
for
Kings
Landing
Ros
the
prostitute
that
Theon
frequently
sees
is
departing
Winterfell
for
Kings
Landing
on
the
back
of
a
turnip
cart
Theon
stops
her
and
unsuccessfully
tries
to
persuade
her
to
stay
She
explains
that
war
is
now
imminent
and
the
men
and
thus
her
customer
base
of
Winterfell
are
destined
to
leave
soon
and
probably
never
return
her
departure
is
thus
an
economically
essential
decision
He
throws
her
a
coin
to
get
her
to
raise
her
skirt
one
last
time
As
she
rides
off
he
says
that
he
will
miss
her
She
agrees
that
he
will
Tyrions
verbal
skills
are
wasted
on
Mord
At
the
Eyrie
At
the
Eyrie
Tyrion
almost
rolls
out
of
his
sky
cell
in
his
sleep
to
his
consternation
He
tries
to
make
a
bargain
with
the
gaoler
Mord
to
no
avail
Tyrion
convinces
Mord
to
carry
a
message
to
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
and
in
exchange
he
will
give
Mord
the
gold
he
had
with
him
when
he
was
captured
Lysa
summons
Tyrion
believing
that
the
sky
cell
has
broken
his
spirit
but
all
he
confesses
to
is
being
a
liar
a
whoremonger
and
a
player
of
practical
jokes
He
maintains
his
innocence
of
the
crimes
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
Tyrion
on
trial
in
the
Eyrie
However
Tyrion
uses
the
opportunity
of
his
audience
in
front
of
Lysas
court
to
publicly
demand
his
right
to
justice
and
a
trial
and
Lysa
is
shamed
into
agreeing
Given
that
Lysas
son
is
a
young
boy
and
wouldnt
make
a
good
judge
in
a
formal
trial
Tyrion
instead
demands
a
trial
by
combat
which
Lysa
also
reluctantly
agrees
is
his
right
Given
that
neither
Lysa
nor
her
young
son
can
fight
in
a
trial
by
combat
she
asks
for
a
volunteer
to
be
her
champion
and
Ser
Vardis
Egen
agrees
Egen
is
unwilling
to
fight
Tyrion
however
as
killing
such
an
outmatched
opponent
would
be
dishonourable
Tyrion
names
his
own
champion
his
brother
Jaime
considered
one
of
the
best
swordsmen
in
the
realm
At
this
Lysa
does
object
as
Jaime
is
not
present
and
she
does
not
want
to
wait
She
demands
that
he
pick
a
champion
from
those
present
Tyrion
desperately
asks
for
volunteers
and
after
a
long
pause
during
which
it
seems
that
Tyrions
cause
is
lost
the
sellsword
Bronn
steps
forward
and
says
he
will
stand
for
him
Bronn
kicks
Ser
Vardis
Egens
corpse
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Bronn
fights
defensively
waiting
for
Vardis
to
tire
as
unlike
Bronn
he
is
dressed
in
full
armor
Bronn
finally
gets
his
chance
he
first
wounds
and
then
kills
Vardis
sending
his
body
rolling
out
of
the
Moon
Door
that
leads
to
a
thousandfoot
drop
Lysa
complains
that
Bronn
did
not
fight
with
honor
Bronn
agrees
but
indicates
that
Vardis
did
fight
with
honor
Tyrion
has
proven
his
innocence
in
the
eyes
of
the
gods
He
retrieves
his
gold
from
Ser
Rodrik
and
gives
it
to
Mord
When
Robin
asks
if
he
can
make
the
little
man
fly
now
Tyrion
says
This
little
man
is
going
home
Bronn
and
Tyrion
are
allowed
to
depart
At
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
and
one
of
her
dragon
eggs
In
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
Targaryen
is
studying
her
dragon
eggs
Despite
Illyrios
claim
that
they
are
now
only
stone
she
ponders
if
they
might
be
hatched
by
extreme
heat
and
places
an
egg
on
a
brazier
Nothing
happens
to
her
disappointment
She
is
removing
the
egg
from
the
brazier
when
Irri
comes
in
and
thinks
she
will
scald
herself
Irri
takes
the
egg
from
her
but
Daenerys
is
completely
unharmed
and
it
is
Irri
who
suffers
scalding
burns
on
her
own
hands
Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
crones
who
rule
the
city
the
dosh
khaleen
the
wives
of
khals
slain
in
battle
She
eats
a
stallions
heart
and
the
crones
read
the
omens
At
first
it
seems
Dany
wont
keep
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The
crones
declare
Daenerys
and
Drogos
son
will
be
The
Stallion
That
Mounts
The
World
a
great
conqueror
whose
coming
is
long
foretold
in
Dothraki
history
Daenerys
says
his
name
will
be
Rhaego
for
her
brother
Rhaegar
slain
by
the
usurper
Robert
Baratheon
Viserys
is
not
impressed
and
rather
disgusted
by
it
all
He
stands
with
Ser
Jorah
who
explains
the
ritual
to
him
It
is
only
when
the
Dothraki
are
chanting
Rhaegos
name
and
Drogo
lifts
Daenerys
up
and
carries
her
about
the
room
that
Viserys
realizes
they
love
her
Jorah
Mormont
prevents
Viserys
from
stealing
Danys
eggs
He
storms
out
of
the
tent
Viserys
is
later
discovered
in
Daenerys
tent
by
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
trying
to
steal
Danys
dragon
eggs
but
Jorah
wont
let
him
Viserys
tells
Ser
Jorah
that
to
rule
one
must
be
feared
or
loved
and
he
has
never
been
loved
as
the
Dothraki
love
Dany
He
says
he
knows
that
Jorah
wants
Daenerys
but
he
doesnt
care
He
just
wants
the
eggs
so
he
can
hire
an
army
but
he
cant
get
past
Ser
Jorah
and
must
leave
the
eggs
Mormont
watches
him
as
he
leaves
Drunk
bitter
and
angry
Viserys
interrupts
a
feast
for
Daenerys
and
Drogo
He
angrily
demands
his
payment
in
return
for
giving
Daenerys
to
Drogo
Then
he
draws
his
sword
which
is
considered
an
offense
punishable
by
death
in
the
sacred
city
and
threatens
Dany
and
the
unborn
child
while
Irri
translates
to
Drogo
Khal
Drogo
gives
Viserys
a
golden
crown
Drogo
responds
that
he
will
give
Viserys
a
golden
crown
that
men
will
tremble
to
behold
and
Viserys
is
pleased
until
Drogos
bloodrider
Qotho
breaks
his
arm
making
him
drop
the
sword
and
kicks
him
to
the
floor
Drogo
melts
his
golden
belt
in
a
pot
while
Viserys
begs
Daenerys
to
help
him
Ser
Jorah
tells
her
to
look
away
but
she
wont
She
watches
as
Khal
Drogo
crowns
Viserys
by
pouring
molten
gold
over
his
head
causing
Viserys
to
cry
out
in
pure
agony
As
Daenerys
watches
her
brother
die
she
coldly
states
that
having
been
killed
by
fire
Viserys
was
no
true
dragon

Natalia
Tena

notably
younger
than
her
character
Osha
is
in
the
books
George
RR
Martin
was
skeptical
when
seeing
her
casting
tape
but
was
impressed
and
convinced
by
her
performance
saying
it
may
affect
how
he
writes
Osha
in
future
novels
This
episode
is
the
final
appearance
of
starring
cast
member
Harry
Lloyd
Viserys
Targaryen
due
to
the
death
of
his
character

halfcrippled
by
gout
Hes
also
one

many
suitors
that
seek
Lady
Lysas
hand
Notes
The
episode
takes
its
name
from
the
golden
crown
Drogo
gives
Viserys
It
may
also
have
a
metaphorical
meaning
in
that
the
word
crown
can
also
refer
to
the
top
of
ones
head
or
the
entire
head
So
a
golden
crown
when
crown
is
used
this
way
could
mean
blondheaded
or
to
use
the
terminology
from
this
episode
golden
haired
This
would
refer
to
Neds
revelation
of
Joffreys
parentage
Actor
Sean
Bean
had
the
flu
while
filming
this
episode
so
the
fevered
appearance
that
Ned
Stark
has
after
being
stabbed
in
the
leg
particularly
when
he
first
wakes
up
in
bed
and
speaks
with
Robert
and
Cersei
is
actually
a
genuine
physical
reaction
by
the
actor
According
to
Emilia
Clarke
for
the
scene
where
Daenerys
eats
a
horses
heart
the
prop
she
used
was
made
of
gummi
bearlike
material
it
tasted
awful
even
though
she
likes
Gummi
bears
Her
difficulty
choking
it
down
is
her
actual
physical
reaction
The
gummiheart
was
injected
with
fakeblood
which
was
basically
a
sugary
syrup
so
that
it
could
burst
out
as
she
bit
into
the
heart
The
crew
kept
injecting
it
to
maintain
moisture
By
the
end
the
actress
was
covered
in
the
stuff
which
was
like
glue
and
everything
stuck
to
her
When
she
used
the
bathroom
she
stuck
to
the
toilet
seat
Viserys
notes
that
Jorah
Mormont
is
blocking
him
from
leaving
with
the
dragon
eggs
by
saying
Here
you
stand
and
Jorah
stares
him
down
by
replying
and
emphasizing
Yet
here
I
stand
In
the
books
the
motto
of
House
Mormont
is
actually
stated
to
be
Here
We
Stand
Its
not
clear
if
this
was
an
intentional
reference
Originally
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
make
the
eight
was
unclear
However
it
appears
to
be
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
Riverlands
having
been
under
the
occupation
of
the
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
at
the
time
of
Aegons
conquest
is
not
counted
as
one
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
the
TV
series
In
the
novels
the
term
is
considerably
looser
and
more
open
to
interpretation
Set
designer
and
art
director
Gemma
Jackson
credits
the
inspiration
for
the
Eyrie
as
being
the
Basilica
Di
San
Clemente
in
Rome
The
Weirwood
Throne
was
actually
three
pieces
of
wood
and
was
unpainted
And
the
Great
Hall
of
the
Red
Keep
was
inspired
by
the
Pantheon
in
Rome
The
trial
by
combat
scene
had
to
be
filmed
across
multiple
takes
and
during
one
actor
Jerome
Flynn
Bronn
accidentally
slipped
and
fell
on
melted
wax
which
was
left
there
from
a
previous
take
when
he
knocked
over
the
candelabra
Once
he
even
fell
into
the
prop
opening
for
the
Moon
Door
Joffrey
mentions
the
northern
and
southernmost
castles
of
Westeros
as
being
the
Last
Hearth
in
the
north
the
seat
of
House
Umber
and
Saltshore
in
Dorne
in
the
south
This
is
not
strictly
accurate
the
northernmost
castles
in
the
realm
are
the
castles
at
the
Wall
most
notably
Castle
Black
It
is
arguable
that
the
southernmost
castles
are
actually
on
the
island
known
as
the
Arbor
but
the
maps
do
not
reveal
at
what
end
of
the
island
the
castles
lie
It
is
possible
that
Joffrey
omitted
the
castles
of
the
Nights
Watch
on
the
Wall
due
to
their
extralegal
status
and
also
he
was
speaking
of
the
lords
and
ladies
who
would
come
to
a
royal
wedding
which
the
Nights
Watch
doesnt
have
There
was
a
discussion
of
how
Jack
Gleason
should
play
this
scene
At
first
he
was
going
to
be
disingenuous
but
then
it
was
decided
that
he
was
more
weak
than
evil
as
he
is
not
utterly
corrupted
until
he
inherits
the
throne
He
is
sincerely
apologizing
as
he
did
really
want
a
girlfriend
The
scene
was
filmed
in
an
overly
romantic
way
to
make
it
seem
melodramatic
Eddard
mentions
several
members
of
House
Baratheon
detailed
in
the
novels
while
reading
the
houses
entry
in
Pycelles
book
Orys
Baratheon
the
founder
of
the
house
Lyonel
Baratheon
the
Laughing
Storm
a
great
knight
featured
in
George
RR
Martins
Dunk
and
Egg
stories
and
Steffon
Baratheon
the
father
of
Robert
Renly
and
Stannis
Viserys
death
scene
had
to
be
performed
in
only
one
take
because
it
would
ruin
his
costume
after
the
first
and
only
attempt
Smoke
machines
were
strapped
to
his
back
and
chest
a
bald
cap
was
made
to
resemble
molten
gold
across
his
face
and
the
props
department
forged
a
goldlike
substance
that
was
poured
over
his
head
This
is
the
first
episode
since
Season
began
that
doesnt
have
a
sex
scene
in
it
Perhaps
not
coincidentally
it
is
also
the
first
and
only
Season
episode
with
a
female
writer
Jane
Espenson
Viserys
calls
his
sister
Dany
Daenerys
is
referred
to
by
that
name
in
her
POV
book
chapters
by
the
writer
but
is
very
rarely
addressed
as
Dany
by
other
characters
both
in
the
books
and
the
show
In
fact
Viserys
is
the
only
book
character
who
ever
used
it
and
only
on
one
occasion
in
the
parallel
book
scene
Commentary
The
Bluray
and
DVD
releases
of
this
episode
feature
a
commentary
by
director
Daniel
Minahan
and
actor
Peter
Dinklage
in
New
York
City
and
Harry
Lloyd
and
Emilia
Clarke
in
London
The
scene
where
Robert
forces
Eddard
to
become
the
Hand
again
was
Mark
Addys
last
scene
shot
for
the
series
Peter
Dinklage
points
out
that
Mark
Addy
is
not
as
big
as
Robert
in
the
books
but
Marks
largerthanlife
performance
sells
the
role
The
costume
and
makeup
designers
worked
hard
not
to
make
Harry
Lloyd
look
like
Legolas
from
the
Lord
of
the
Rings
movies
Emilia
Clarke
was
charmed
when
Isaac
HempsteadWright
gave
her
half
his
Fudge
bar
Harry
Lloyd
is
a
fan
of
Natalia
Tenas
band
There
was
some
debate
about
using
CGI
breath
for
the
really
cold
scenes
filmed
in
warmer
weather
but
it
was
decided
it
looked
too
fake
Peter
Dinklage
was
unaware
that
Maisie
Williams
used
her
offhand
for
the
swordfighting
scenes
to
match
Arya
in
the
books
and
was
impressed
Maisie
cried
on
cue
during
the
readthrough
of
the
scene
where
she
has
to
drive
Nymeria
away
impressing
Harry
Lloyd
Peter
Dinklage
said
that
the
scene
where
Daenerys
eats
the
horses
heart
is
his
wifes
favorite
scene
of
the
entire
series
The
scene
between
Viserys
and
Jorah
was
discussed
between
the
two
actors
and
David
Benioff
to
get
the
right
tone
to
the
scene
Peter
Dinklage
had
no
padding
for
the
scenes
where
Mord
beats
him
in
the
sky
cell
so
ended
up
with
some
bruises
at
the
end
of
the
day
Some
actors
were
given
prosthetic
scars
while
others
had
real
scars
that
were
highlighted
with
makeup
The
throne
dais
in
the
Eyrie
had
no
safety
rail
so
actress
Kate
Dickie
was
directed
to
keep
hold
of
Lino
Facioli
when
he
stood
up
as
a
safety
precaution
The
Moon
Door
actually
led
to
a
pit
filled
with
cardboard
boxes
Harry
Lloyd
likens
the
Vale
to
Wales
so
finds
the
fact
that
Ser
Vardis
Egen
has
a
Welsh
accent
very
appropriate
Peter
Dinklage
was
a
fan
of
Kate
Dickie
from
some
of
her
British
film
work
and
was
looking
forward
to
meeting
her
Originally
the
episode
opened
with
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
sacking
a
village
in
the
Riverlands
but
this
was
cut
for
time
and
budget
reasons
Peter
Dinklage
and
Emilia
Clarke
only
read
the
books
once
they
have
finished
filming
so
as
to
be
surprised
by
the
process
as
it
goes
along
Bryan
Cogman
also
tracked
down
scenes
from
later
books
that
gave
more
info
about
the
characters
and
their
motivations
and
recommended
them
to
the
actors
Harry
Lloyd
looks
at
fan
art
online
and
particularly
enjoyed
a
fan
map
of
Braavos
that
he
found
on
the
Internet
Emilia
Clarke
was
disappointed
that
the
elaborate
and
lengthy
climb
to
the
Eyrie
was
not
in
the
TV
series
Peter
Dinklage
noted
the
name
similarity
between
Jack
Gleeson
and
comedian
Jackie
Gleason
and
found
it
amusing
Peter
Dinklage
debated
with
his
wife
whether
it
was
realistic
for
there
to
be
only
one
prostitute
in
Winterfell
However
she
pointed
out
in
a
small
community
there
was
only
likely
to
be
one
or
at
least
one
popular
one
The
coin
Ros
catches
from
the
back
of
the
cart
was
CGI
Harry
Lloyd
mishears
the
comment
however
and
momentarily
thinks
they
said
Ross
flash
was
CGI
According
to
Peter
Dinklage
the
CGI
budget
for
Season
will
be
huge
Harry
Lloyd
studied
a
lot
of
drunk
walking
videos
on
YouTube
for
his
final
scene
The
sword
Harry
Lloyd
used
in
the
final
scene
was
very
sharp
and
had
to
be
handled
carefully
Drogos
gold
belt
melted
far
too
quickly
Lloyd
deadpans
this
is
because
it
is
Dothraki
hybrid
gold
that
melts
much
more
quickly
than
normal
and
then
solidifies
again
The
final
shot
of
Daenerys
required
multiple
takes
as
it
was
tricky
to
keep
the
camera
in
focus
as
it
zoomed
in
close
on
her
face
For
the
scene
where
Viserys
is
crowned
the
prop
department
attached
smoke
machines
to
Harry
Lloyds
back
and
front
and
placed
a
bald
cap
over
his
head
to
make
it
look
like
his
hair
and
skin
was
being
burned
They
also
created
a
goldlooking
but
cold
liquid
to
pour
over
his
head
Due
to
the
complexity
of
the
scene
the
scene
had
to
be
nailed
in
one
take
which
was
successfully
achieved

quotes
Syrio
Forel
There
is
only
one
god
And
his
name
is
Death
And
there
is
only
one
thing
we
say
to
Death
not
today
Bronn
Ill
stand
for
the
dwarf
Robert
Baratheon
Back
in
our
day
you
werent
a
real
man
until
youd
fucked
one
girl
from
each
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
the
Riverlands
We
used
to
call
it
making
the
eight
Littlefinger
A
bold
move
my
lord
And
admirable
But
is
it
wise
to
yank
the
lions
tail
Tywin
Lannister
is
the
richest
man
in
all
Seven
Kingdoms
Gold
wins
wars
not
soldiers
Eddard
Stark
Then
how
come
Robert
is
king
and
not
Tywin
Lannister
Arya
Stark
Cant

take
Syrio
back

Sansa
Stark
Who

stupid
dancing
teacher
I

Arya
Stark
Seven
hells
Eddard
Stark
When

Ill

you
a
match

someone

you
Someone
who
is
brave
and
gentle
and
strong
Sansa
Stark
I
dont
want
someone
brave
and
gentle
and
strong
I
want
him
Arya
and
Ned
barely
restrain
a
giggle
at
Sansas
distress
Hell
be
the
greatest
king
there
ever
was
a
golden
lion
and
Ill
give
him
sons
with
beautiful
blond
hair
A
look
of
realization
spreads
across
Neds
face
after
listening
to
the
last
part
of
Sansas
statement
Arya
Stark
The
lions
not
his
sigil
idiot
Hes
a
stag
like
his
father
Sansa
Stark
He
is
not
He
is
nothing
like
that
old
drunk
king
Eddard
Stark
Go

Get
your
septas
and
start
packing
your
things
Sansa
Stark
Wait
Arya
Stark
Come
on
Sansa
Stark
But
its
not
fair
The
girls
leave
the
room
and
Eddard
sits
down
at

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Oldtown
was
the
largest
city
in
Westeros
before
the
Targaryen
conquest
It
survived
for
so
long
through
canny
politicking
by
the
ruling
Hightowers
who
trace
their
ancestry
back
to
the
First
Men
In
time
through
patronage
of
local
kings
of
the
First
Men
the
Order
of
Maesters
was
founded
in
Oldtown
a
guild
of
scholars
and
healers
with
their
headquarters
located
at
the
Citadel
in
the
city
When
the
Andals
invaded
the
Hightowers
then
kings
in
their
own
right
welcomed
them
openly
and
swore
fealty
to
them
as
Kings
of
the
Reach
Oldtowns
preeminence
was
confirmed
when
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
built
the
Starry
Sept
there
During
the
invasion
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
the
High
Septon
of
the
time
prayed
and
fasted
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
on
whether
the
Hightowers
should
resist
Aegons
army
He
received
a
vision
showing
Oldtowns
destruction
should
they
attempt
this
At
his
recommendation
the
thenLord
Hightower
threw
open
the
city
gates
and
welcomed
Aegon
into
the
city
with
open
arms
Aegon
dated
the
first
day
of
his
reign
to
his
welcome
into
Oldtown
Oldtown
is
almost
as
large
and
populous
as
Kings
Landing
but
is
far
cleaner
more
beautiful
and
more
efficiently
run
Kings
Landing
was
rapidly
constructed
within
the
first
century
of
rule
by
the
Targaryen
dynasty
This
rapid
expansion
didnt
keep
pace
with
organized
cityplanning
resulting
in
numerous
slums
forming
such
as
the
district
known
as
Flea
Bottom
Many
of
these
slum
districts
are
poorly
organized
ugly
and
filthy
because
their
placement
wasnt
thought
out
during
the
rush
to
slap
down
new
buildings
By
contrast
Oldtown
is
thousands
of
years
old
and
grew
only
in
incremental
steps
which
were
well
planned
out
beforehand
The
result
is
that
Oldtown
is
a
much
better
organized
and
beautiful
city
without
the
squalid
slums
of
Kings
Landing
while
being
only
slightly
smaller
than
the
capital
itself
Oldtown
also
has
its
own
City
Watch
separate
from
the
City
Watch
of
Kings
Landing
Oldtown
is
famed
for
its
meandering
cobbled
streets
and
many
fine
inns
and
septs
It
has
an
immense
port
which
plays
host
to
ships
from
across
the
Seven
Kingdoms
the
Free
Cities
and
even
the
distant
Summer
Islands
The
port
and
the
entire
city
is
dominated
by
the
Hightower
a
massive
sevensided
stepped
lighthouse
rising
from
Battle
Island
More
than
feet
high
it
is
the
tallest
structure
in
Westeros
higher
even
than
the
Wall
It
serves
as
House
Hightowers
keep
as
well
as
a
lighthouse
Oldtown
has
had
the
misfortune
as
a
large
city
of
being
struck
twice
by
major
plagues
in
the
past
century
In
AL
a
great
pandemic
known
as
the
Great
Spring
Sickness
swept
across
all
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
It
killed
tens
of
thousands
particularly
in
the
major
cities
It
was
bad
in
Lannisport
worse
in
Oldtown
but
worst
of
all
in
Kings
Landing
where
two
out
of
every
five
persons
died
The
death
count
wasnt
quite
as
severe
in
Oldtown
but
still
high
Only
one
generation
later
during
Grand
Maester
Pycelles
youth
s
to
s
AL
Oldtown
itself
was
hit
by
an
even
worse
disease
the
grey
plague
a
more
deadly
cousin
of
Greyscale
According
to
Pycelle
the
outbreak
killed
up
to
half
of
Oldtowns
population
and
three
quarters
of
the
maesters
in
the
Citadel
The
only
reason
it
didnt
become
another
even
more
destructive
pandemic
is
because
Lord
Quenton
Hightower
ordered
the
gates
of
the
city
sealed
and
all
ships
in
the
harbor
burned
to
prevent
the
disease
being
spread
further
While
this
did
prevent
another
pandemic
many
trapped
inside
the
citys
quarantine
caught
the
disease
from
those
who
were
already
sick
and
perished
After
the
quarantine
ended
the
survivors
dragged
Lord
Quenton
and
his
young
son
from
their
horses
and
slit
their
throats
By
the
time
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
some
seventy
years
later
Oldtowns
population
is
slightly
smaller
than
that
of
Kings
Landing
but
it
may
have
been
larger
over
a
century
ago
before
the
doubleblow
of
these
two
epidemics
and
when
Kings
Landing
was
smaller
No
one
knows
exactly
how
old
the
city
really
is
fading
back
into
the
mists
of
history
and
oral
tradition
there
was
always
a
major
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
the
Honeywine
though
it
did
grow
and
expand
considerably
over
the
millennia
The
First
Men
apparently
founded
the
original
town
that
later
became
a
city
relatively
soon
after
they
first
began
migrating
into
Westeros
years
ago
across
the
nearby
landbridge
at
the
time
linking
Dorne
and
Essos
A
few
maesters
argue
that
there
may
have
been
even
earlier
settlements
at
the
mouth
of
the
Honeywine
that
the
First
Men
built
over
perhaps
a
trading
post
maintained
by
anyone
from
the
Valyrians
to
the
Rhoynar
to
the
Summer
Islanders
or
a
combination
of
them
where
their
fishing
fleets
could
take
on
fresh
water
and
perhaps
even
trade
with
the
nonhuman
races
that
dominated
Westeross
wild
forests
at
the
time
the
Children
of
the
Forest
and
the
Giants
The
base
of
the
Hightower
and
underground
levels
seem
to
be
the
remnant
of
some
ancient
structure
made
of
an
oily
black
stone
found
in
a
few
other
ruins
across
the
world
The
evidence
however
is
very
sketchy
and
inconclusive
Oldtown
remains
aloof
from
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
In
the
fourth
novelEuron
Greyjoy
launches
a
massive
raid
along
the
coast
conquering
the
Shield
Islands
and
parts
of
the
Arbor
thentrying
to
blockade
the
mouth
of
the
Honeywine
An
ironborn
attack
on
the
citys
harbor
is
repulsed
by
the
citys
defenders
Oldtown
remains
under
threat
from
the
ironborn
Reallife
connection
Oldtown
bears
many
similarities
to
reallife
Alexandria
This
Egyptian
city
founded
in
the
th
Century
BCE
by
Alexander
the
Great
was
and
still
is
a
major
port
on
the
Mediterranean
Sea
receiving
ships
and
cargoes
from
all
over
known
world
The
Citadel
of
Oldtown
with
its
enormous
library
and
status
as
a
place
of
learning
is
very
similar
to
the
famed
Library
of
Alexandria
the
preeminent
educational
center
of
its
time
Perhaps
most
strongly
the
Hightower
of
Oldtown
is
a
clear
parallel
to
Alexandrias
famous
lighthouse
one
of
the
Seven
Wonders
of
the
Ancient
World

among

son
Torrhen

is
later
killed
by

during
an
escape
attempt
After
Jaimes
recapture
Lord
Rickard
demands
Jaimes
execution
in
revenge
for
the
murder
of
his
son
but
Catelyn
Stark
speaks
for
his
life
After
Lord
Rickards
threatening
reaction
she
reminds
him
that
he
has
sworn
an
oath
of
loyalty
to
Robb
Stark
and
that
Jaime
is
a
prisoner
of
war
She

that
he
should
remember
who
his
king
is
and
who
she
is
She
promises
him
that
Jaime
will
be
punished
for
what
he
did
Reluctantly
Lord
Karstark
gives
in
but
demands
retribution
when
his
King
returns
from
The
Crag
During
the
confrontation
with
Lady
Catelyn
Lord
Rickard
also
dismisses
Talisa
Maegyr
as
a
foreign
bitch
Catelyn
sends
Jaime
to
Kings
Landing
with
her
sworn
sword
Brienne
to
exchange
him
for
her
captive
daughters
fearing
that
Rickard
or
his
men
will
kill
him
if
he
remains
in
the
camp
He
is
furious
that
she
has
denied
him
his
vengeance
and
rejects
her
argument
that
Jaime
may
yet
save
the
lives
of
her
children
adding
that
he
personally
would
happily
exchange
his
life
for
those
of
his
deceased
children
Torrhen
and
Harrion
even
if
it
meant
captivity
for
them
Robb
tells
Catelyn
that
she
has
betrayed
him
and
orders
her
kept
under
guard
Season
Rickard
and
Roose
Bolton
find
the
slaughtered
prisoners
at
Harrenhal
Rickards
faith
in
Robb
continues
to
deteriorate
as
the
Northern
host
arrives
at
Harrenhal
finding
the
castles
inhabitants
had
been
put
to
the
sword
Roose
Bolton
attempts
to
reassure
Rickard
telling
him
that
he
has
sent
his
best
hunter
in
pursuit
of
the
Kingslayer
and
that
the
dead
will
be
avenged
in
time
Karstark
however
is
clearly
unconvinced
Lord
Karstark
manifests
his
disapproval
of
the
march
to
Riverrun
for
the
funerals
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
grandfather
of
his
King
considering
it
a
distraction
from
the
war
effort
When
questioned
by
Robb
if
he
has
lost
faith
in
the
Northern
cause
Lord
Karstark
insists
that
if
the
cause
is
revenge
he
will
keep
faith
until
it
snows
in
Dorne
but
adds
that
he
believes
Robb
lost
the
war

day
he
married
Talisa

Karstarkand

killMartynandWillem
Lannisterin
the
dungeons
of
Riverrunand
are
brought
before
Robb
Stark
He
openly
insults
the
King
in
the
North
and
claims
the
war
is
a
lost
causeRemaining
true
to
his
honor
just
like
his
father
Robb
decides
that
Lord
Karstarkmust
die
for
his
treason
Though
Edmure
Tully
Talisa
and
Catelyn
attempt
to
advise
Robb
to
hold
Karstark
hostage
and
send
him
to
the
Nights
Watch
after
the
war
on
the
basis
that
the
Karstarks
form
a
significant
portion
of
Robbs
army
and
they
will
abandon
Robb
if
he
executes
their
lord
Despite
the
warnings
of
all
of
his
councilors
Robb
refuses
to
listen
Rickard
Karstark
is
executed
by
Robb
Stark
As
Lord
Karstark
is
brought
before
Robb
he
reminds
him
that
the
blood
of
the
First
Menrun
through
bothof
their
veins
since
they
are
of
the
North
Lord
Karstark
also
reminds
Robb
he
fought
alongside
Eddard
Stark
during
Roberts
Rebellionand
alongside
him
against
KingJoffrey
Finally
he
states
that
they
are
both
kin
since
House
Karstark
was
founded
by
a
Stark
of
Winterfell
Robb
tells
him
that
all
of
it
didnt
stop
him
from
murdering
the
Lannister
boys
and
it
will
not
save
him
now
Rickard
doesnt
want
to
be
saved
but
he
wants
it
to
haunt
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
True
to
the
traditions
of
the
North
and
his
father
Robb
Stark
personally
beheads
Rickard
Karstark
with
a
single
strike
of
his
sword
after
Rickard
curses
Robb
and
renounces
all
allegiance
to
him
In
the
aftermath
the
Karstark
forces
abandon
Robb
and
return
home
In
the
meantime
while
he
is
being
tortured
in
the
Dreadfort
Theon
Greyjoy
incorrectly
assumes
Ramsay
Snow
to
be
Rickards
son
keeping
him
prisoner
on
Rickards
orders
since
he
is
Robbs
bannerman
remaining
unaware
that
Rickard
has
been
executed
Season
Rickard
is
mentioned
by
his
last
living
son
Harald
Karstark
when
he
meets
with
the
Boltonsat
Winterfell
Harald
makes
it
clear
that
his
house
will
never
support
the
Starks
again
after
Robb
executed
his
father
Despite
the
fact
that
Roose
avenged
his
father
by
killing
Robb
at
the
Red
Wedding
Harald
makes
no
attempt
to
intervene
when
Ramsay
kills
Roose
after
the
birth
of
his
halfbrother
whom
Ramsay
also
murders
along
with
his
stepmother
Walda
Bolton
While
planning
to
counter
the
Boltons
claim
to
the
North
Sansa
Stark
expresses
her
belief
that
the
Karstarks
will
support
them
when
they
learn
of
Jon
Snows
resurrection
but
Ser
Davos
Seaworth
reminds
her
that
Rickard
was
executed
by
Robb
which
is
likely
why
Rickards
last
surviving
son
has
sided
with
the
Starks
enemies
and
not
out
of
ignorance
as
Sansa
had
hoped

Behind
the
scenes
Originally
Vinnie
McCabe
had
been
announced
in
the
role
of
Rickard
Karstark
however
he
turned
out
to
be
playing
a
Lannister
bannerman
Leo
Lefford
in
the
same
episode
as
Karstarks
debut
Steven
Blount
appeared
as
a
Stark
bannerman
in
Fire
and
Blood
Blounts
character
was
given
lines
spoken
by
Rickard
Karstark
in
the
book
and
his
CV
lists
him
as
playing
Lord
Karstark
For
the
second
season
it
was
announced
that
John
Stahl
was
playing
Rickard
Karstark
Stahl
was
named
on
screen
as
Lord
Karstark
in
A
Man
Without
Honor
Bryan
Cogman
acknowledged
that
Rickard
Karstark
worships
the
Old
Gods
so
his
line
that
he
would
cut
his
own
heart
out
and
offer
it
to
the
Father
one
of
the
Seven
if
it
would
bring
his
sons
back
is
an
error
Cogman
reconciled
this
by
saying
that
Lord
Rickards
line
should
be
understood
as
simply
being
very
sarcastic
ie
equivalent
to
if
he
had
said
Id
rip
out
my
heart
and
offer
it
up
to
the
Great
Stallion
of
the
Dothraki
if
it
would
bring
my
sons
back
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Rickard
Karstark
is
the
ruling
lord
of
House
Karstark
of
Karhold
Their
lands
are
along
a
heavilyforested
headland
far
to
the
northeast
of
Winterfell
overlooking
the
Shivering
Sea
He
is
named
for
Eddard
Starks
father
Rickard
and
fought
in
Roberts
Rebellion
alongside
his
liege
lord
He
has
four
children
Harrion
Torrhen
Eddard
and
Alys
who
is
in
the
television
series
depicted
as
Rickards
granddaughter
Hes
described
as
gaunt
and
longbearded
and
Jon
Snow
implies
he
is
a
fierce
warrior
Two
of
Lord
Rickards
sons
Torrhen
and
Eddard
are
struck
down
by
Jaime
Lannister
in
the
Battle
of
the
Whispering
Wood
while
he
kills
Stafford
Lannister
at
the
Battle
of
Oxcross
Lord
Rickards
mention
of
losing
a
son
to
Jaime
prior
to
Torrhens
death
seems
to
reference
Eddards
death
at
the
Whispering
Wood
Though
clearly
angered
that
Jaime
is
kept
alive
Lord
Rickard
doesnt
openly
demand
the
execution
of
Jaime
Catelyns
decision
to
send
Jaime
back
to
Kings
Landing
isnt
caused
by
Karstarks
actions
but
of
fear
that
Joffrey
may
execute
Sansa
on
a
whim
as
she
believes
Theon
has
executed
Bran
and
Rickon
Lord
Rickard
becomes
furious
when
Robb
forgives
Catelyn
for
her
actions
and
murders
the
hostages
Willem
Lannister
and
Tion
Frey
not
Martyn
Lannister
Robb
subsequently
orders
Rickard
executed
and
the
Karstarks
abandon
him
Rickard
is
succeeded
by
his
son
Harrion
who
is
currently
held
prisoner
by
the
Lannisters
and
his
whereabouts
are
unknown
it
is
uncertain
if
he
is
still
alive
Arnolf
Rickards
uncle
and
the
castellan
of
Karhold
tries
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
in
order
to
take
over
Karhold
he
announces
in
public
that
he
supports
Stannis
while
he
actually
collaborates
with
the
Boltons
hoping
that
the
Lannisters
will
react
by
executing
Harrion
then
Rickards
daughter
Alys
will
become
the
heiress
of
Karhold
Arnolf
plans
to
force
Alys
to
marry
his
son
Cregan
thereby
to
claim
Karhold
legally
Alys
escapes
from
Karhold
and
tells
Jon
Snow
about
her
greatuncles
treachery
Arnolfs
scheme
is
foiled
Stannis
is
warned
in
time
about
the
traitor
in
his
host
and
arrests
him
and
Alys
is
wed
to
Sigorn
son
of
Styr
Rickards
execution
has
severe
consequences
in
the
books
while
the
TV
series
make
it
clear
that
all
of
the
Karstark
forces
abandoned
Robb
it
is
implied
in
the
books
that
the
few
Karstarks
who
remained
with
Robb
following
Rickards
execution
played
a
role
in
the
Red
Wedding

In

Remembers
DB
Weiss
revealed
that
falcons
representing

on
the
wall
still
remain
since
neither
Ned
Starknor
Tyrion
Lannister
have
had
time
to
redecorate
after
Jon
Arryns
death
In
the
books
In
A
Feast
for
Crows
following
the
death
of
Tywin
Lannister
Cersei
orders
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
burned
to
the
ground
by
wildfire
because
she
cannot
bear
its
look
keeping
in
mind
that
her
father
dies
inside
it
a
whore
in
his
bed
she
also
hope
the
fire
may
smoke
a
few
rats
from
the
rubble
like
Tyrion
and
Varys
Jaime
objects
fearing
that
the
fire
will
spread
beyond
the
tower
but
Cersei
insists
She
is
angered
by
Jaimes
comment
Now
you
sound
like
Aerys

of
the
tower
is
peformed
right
after
the
wedding
of
Tommen
and
Margaery
The
guests
watch
in
awe
how
the
tower
is
burnt
as
if
it
is
a
fireworks
display
Since
everyone
knows
about
Cerseis
plan
in
advance
no
one
is
harmed
by
the
destruction
of
the
building
Watching
the
building
being
consumed
by
wildfire
Cersei
feels
a
strange
excitement
as
if
the
wildfire
is
cleansing
her
burning
away
all
her
rage
and
fear
filling
her
with
resolve
Jaime
notices
her
expression
and
is
filled
with
disquiet
it
strongly
reminds
him
of
the
mad
king
and
the
way
a
burning
would
sexually
arouse
him
In
A
Dance
with
Dragons
Cersei
tells
Kevan
that
Mace
Tyrell
seeks
to
rebuild
the
Tower
Kevan
comments
that
the

The

group
within

social
hierarchy
specifically
the
crones
who
preside
over
the
holy
city
of
Vaes
Dothrak
The
dosh
khaleen
are
composed
of
the
widows
of
slain
khals
and
serve
as
seers
foretelling
the
future
and
interpreting
omens
for
the
Dothraki
In
this
capacity
they
essentially
also
serve
as
the
leaders
of
the
Dothraki
religion
Even
powerful
khals
and
fierce
male
Dothraki
warriors
fear
disobeying
the

of
the

The
name
dosh
khaleen
literally
means
council
of
crones
in
the
Dothraki
language
Each
one
of
them
was
formerly
the

and
thus
each

In

Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
dosh
khaleen
to
eat
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the

At

it
seems
she
wont
hold
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The

son
will

says
his

RhaegarTargaryen
who

rebellion
byRobert
Baratheon
Season
After
being
captured
by
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
was
offered
to
Khal
Moro
as
a
gift
She
eventually
earned
the
respect
of
the
khal
after
explaining
to
him
that
she
was
Khal
Drogos
wife
However
instead
of
escorting
her
to
Meereen
as
per
her
request
Khal
Moros
wife
tells
her
that
she
must
remain
in
the
temple
of
Vaes
Dothrak
with
the
dosh
khaleen
for
the
rest
of
her
life
as
she
was
a
widow
of
a
khal
and
a
former
khaleesi
Daenerys
is
welcomed
to
the
Temple
by
the
High
Priestess
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
who
admonishes
her
for
not
returning
to
the
Temple
immediately
after
Khal
Drogos
death
She
relates
her
own
history
as
the
wife
of
Khal
Savo
to
connect
with
Daenerys
but
warns
her
that
because
she
violated
tradition
it
is
up
to
the
khals
assembling
for
the
Khalar
vezhven
to
decide
whether
Daenerys
will
join
their
ranks
Later
on
the
High
Priestess
clearly
hoping
that
Daenerys
will
be
allowed
to
stay
with
them
explains
the
politics
of
the
dosh
khaleen
and
that
some
of
them
dislike
Daenerys
and
her
obvious
Valyrian
features
thinking
that
the
Dothraki
shouldnt
breed
with
outsiders
The
high
priestess
dismisses
them
however
pointing
out
that
the
Dothraki
have
always
interbred
and
taken
outsiders
as
khaleesi
She
points
out
a
khaleen
of
Lhazareen
origin
to
illustrate
her
point
During
the
khalar
vezhven
the
dosh
khaleen
bring
Daenerys
before
the
Khals
to
be
judged
but
it
seems
they
are
barred
from
attending
themselves
The
Mother
of
Dragons
turns
the
tables
on
the
khals
and
destroys
the
Temple
of
the

everyone
inside

Daenerys
Targaryen
meets
with
the
dosh
khaleen
so
they
can
interpret
omens
about
her
child
The
dosh
khaleen
are
a
ruling
organization
within
the
Dothraki
social
hierarchy
specifically
the
crones
who
preside
over
the
holy
city
of
Vaes
Dothrak
The
dosh
khaleen
are
comprised
of
the
widows
of
slain
khals
and
serve
as
seers
foretelling
the
future
and
interpreting
omens
for
the
Dothraki
In
this
capacity
they
essentially
also
serve
as
the
leaders
of
the
Dothraki
religion
Even
powerful
khals
and
fierce
male
Dothraki
warriors
fear
disobeying
the
will
of
the
dosh
khaleen

History
Season
Daenerys
eats
a
horses
heart
in
a
ritual
conducted
by
the
dosh
khaleen
seen
behind
her
In
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
dosh
khaleen
to
eat
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
crones
can
read
the
omens
At
first
it
seems
she
wont
hold
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The
crones
declare
Daenerys
and
Drogos
son
will
be
The
Stallion
Who
Mounts
the
World
a
great
conqueror
whose
coming
is
long
foretold
in
Dothraki
history
Daenerys
says
his
name
will
be
Rhaego
for
her
brother
Rhaegar
slain

the

In

A
Song

Fire
novels
the
dosh
khaleen
have
great
honor
and
status
amongst
the
Dothraki
At
their
bidding
no
blood
may
be
spilled
or
blade
bared
within
the
confines
of
Vaes
Dothrak
though
this
does
not
prevent
other
inventive
forms
of
killing
Daenerys
as
the
wife
of
Khal
Drogo
is
told
that
when
Drogo
dies
she
will
be
expected
to
return
to
Vaes
Dothrak
and
join
the
dosh
khaleen
on
pain

Daenerys

meets
with

dosh

so
they
can
interpret

about
her

The
dosh
khaleen
are
a
ruling
group
within
the
Dothraki
social
hierarchy
specifically
the
crones
who
preside
over
the
holy
city
of
Vaes
Dothrak
The
dosh
khaleen
are
composed
of
the
widows
of
slain
khals
and
serve
as
seers
foretelling
the
future
and
interpreting
omens
for
the
Dothraki
In
this
capacity
they
essentially
also
serve
as
the
leaders
of
the
Dothraki
religion
Even
powerful
khals
and
fierce
male
Dothraki
warriors
fear
disobeying
the
will
of
the
dosh
khaleen
The
name
dosh
khaleen
literally
means
council
of
crones
in
the
Dothraki
language
Each
one
of
them
was
formerly
the
wife
of
a
khal
and
thus
each
of
them
was
once
a
khaleesi
An
individual
member
of
the
group
would
be
called
a
khaleen

crone

Season
Daenerys
eats
a
Stallion
heart
in
a
ritual
conducted
by
the
dosh
khaleen
seen
behind
her
In
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
dosh
khaleen
to
eat
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
crones
can
read
the
omens
At
first
it
seems
she
wont
hold
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The
crones
declare
Daenerys
and
Drogos
son
will
be
The
Stallion
Who
Mounts
the
World
a
great
conqueror
whose
coming
is
long
foretold
in
Dothraki
history
Daenerys
says
his
name
will
be
Rhaego
after
her
brother
RhaegarTargaryen
who
wasslain
in
the
rebellion
byRobert
Baratheon
Season
After
being
captured
by
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
was
offered
to
Khal
Moro
as
a
gift
She
eventually
earned
the
respect
of
the
khal
after
explaining
to
him
that
she
was
Khal
Drogos
wife
However
instead
of
escorting
her
to
Meereen
as
per
her
request
Khal
Moros
wife
tells
her
that
she
must
remain
in
the
temple
of
Vaes
Dothrak
with
the
dosh
khaleen
for
the
rest
of
her
life
as
she
was
a
widow
of
a
khal
and
a
former
khaleesi
Daenerys
is
welcomed
to
the
Temple
by
the
High
Priestess
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
who
admonishes
her
for
not
returning
to
the
Temple
immediately
after
Khal
Drogos
death
She
relates
her
own
history
as
the
wife
of
Khal
Savo
to
connect
with
Daenerys
but
warns
her
that
because
she
violated
tradition
it
is
up
to
the
khals
assembling
for
the
Khalar
vezhven
to
decide
whether
Daenerys
will
join
their
ranks
Later
on
the
High
Priestess
clearly
hoping
that
Daenerys
will
be
allowed
to
stay
with
them
explains
the
politics
of
the
dosh
khaleen
and
that
some
of
them
dislike
Daenerys
and
her
obvious
Valyrian
features
thinking
that
the
Dothraki
shouldnt
breed
with
outsiders
The
high
priestess
dismisses
them
however
pointing
out
that
the
Dothraki
have
always
interbred
and
taken
outsiders
as
khaleesi
She
points
out
a
khaleen
of
Lhazareen
origin
to
illustrate
her
point
During
the
khalar
vezhven
the
dosh
khaleen
bring
Daenerys
before
the
Khals
to
be
judged
but
it
seems
they
are
barred
from
attending
themselves
The
Mother
of
Dragons
turns
the
tables
on
the
khals
and
destroys
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
killing
everyone
inside
The
dosh
khaleen
are
amongst
the
crowd
gathering
to
watch
the
conflagration
and
when
they
see
Daenerys
emerge
from
the
flames
unburnt
they

the
rest

David
Benioff
was
sent
a
collection
of
the
first
four
novels
in
the
series
A
Game
of
Thrones
A
Clash
of
Kings
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
A
Feast
for
Crows
by
George
RR
Martins
agent
Initially
sceptical
of
the
fantasy
genre
Benioff
became
a
big
fan
of
the
books
and
invited
his
friend
DB
Weiss
to
develop
the
project
with
him
for
a
screen
adaptation
They
initially
considered
a
movie
adaption
but
realized
this
would
mean
losing
most
of
the
plot
and
characters
from
the
books
Instead
they
began
working
on
an
adaptation
for
television
They
met
with
George
RR
Martin
and
spent
several
hours
discussing
the
project
Martin
was
impressed
with
their
enthusiasm
and
that
they
had
already
worked
out
the
resolutions
to
several
key
mysteries
in
the
books
He
agreed
with
them
that
the
series
was
a
good
fit
for
the
cable
company
HBO
which
Martin
was
already
a
big
fan
of
HBO
agreed
to
option
the
project
in
and
active
development
of
a
pilot
script
began
However
this
was
delayed
by
the
Writers
Guild
of
America
strike
In
October
HBO
exercised
its
option
to
buy
the
rights
to
the
series
and
ordered
a
pilot
episode
a
few
weeks
later
Casting
announcements
were
made
throughout
with
Peter
Dinklage
the
first
actor
formally
announced
for
the
series
The
pilot
episode
was
filmed
in
Northern
Ireland
and
Morocco
in
October
and
November
HBO
officially
greenlit
the
series
on
March
Filming
of
Season
began
on
July
with
Malta
replacing
Morocco
for
overseas
filming
Several
actors
from
the
pilot
were
recast
requiring
the
refilming
of
most
of
the
first
episode
The
season
wrapped
filming
on
December
HBO
later
confirmed
that
the
first
season
had
a
budget
of
million
The
first
season
aired
on
HBO
on
April
June
garnering
critical
acclaim
and
steadily
rising
ratings
HBO
confirmed
after
the
transmission
of
the
first
episode
that
a
second
season
had
been
commissioned
Production
of
Season
began
on
July
and
wrapped
on
December
Malta
was
dropped
as
a
filming
location
replaced
by
Croatia
while
additional
filming
took
place
in
Iceland
The
budget
for
Season
was
higher
than
Season
necessitated
by
the
addition
more
ambitious
effects
sequences
and
the
use
of
CGI
creatures
such
as
direwolves
and
dragons
The
second
season
aired
from
April
to
June
garnering
additional
critical
acclaim
and
increased
ratings
By
the
end
of
the
second
season
the
show
had
become
the
thirdmostsuccessful
series
in
HBOs
history
behind
only
The
Sopranos
and
True
Blood
In
addition
the
DVD
and
Bluray
set
of
Season
was
released
just
prior
to
transmission
of
Season
and
immediately
became
HBOs
fastestselling
media
release
in
its
history
Production
of
Season
began
on
July
and
wrapped
on
November
Morocco
was
added
to
the
filming
roster
alongside
Croatia
Iceland
and
Northern
Ireland
with
the
complexities
of
filming
requiring
the
addition
of
a
third
filming
unit
to
the
existing
two
An
additional
scene
was
shot
in
Los
Angeles
for
safety
reasons
meaning
that
Season
was
filmed
in
five
separate
countries
on
three
continents
The
season
aired
from
March
to
June
The
penultimate
episode
The
Rains
of
Castamere
won
widespread
critical
acclaim
for
its
shock
twist
ending
By
the
end
of
the
season
the
show
had
supplanted
True
Blood
as
the
secondmost
successful
HBO
show
in
the
United
States
and
The
Sopranos
as
its
most
successful
series
worldwide
Production
of
Season
began
on
July
and
concluded
on
November
Production
was
more
focused
this
season
with
only
two
units
used
and
filming
restricted
to
Northern
Ireland
Iceland
and
Croatia
This
was
to
allow
more
of
the
budget
to
be
concentrated
on
several
major
action
and
effects
sequences
late
in
the
season
Production
of
Season
ran
from
July
to
December
Production
was
focused
once
more
with
two
units
filming
in
Northern
Ireland
Croatia
and
Spain
with
Spain
being
a
new
addition
to
the
shows
shooting
countries
Production
of
Season
ran
from
midJuly
to
December
Filming
took
place
in
Northern
Ireland
and
Spain
while
the
production
only
returned
to
Croatia
for
a
brief
shoot
as
they
used
several
locations
in
Spain
as
exterior
sets
for
Kings
Landing
Braavos
and
Meereen
Production
of
Season
ran
from
August
to
February
which
was
later
than
past
seasons
mainly
due
to
the
desire
to
accurately
depict
the
winter
that
now
grips
Westeros
and
will
be
shortened
to
seven
episodes
due
to
the
smaller
amount
of
story
content
remaining
as
well
as
the
increased
production
values
and
time
required
to
film
episodes
involving
larger
set
pieces
Filming
took
place
in
Northern
Ireland
Spain
Iceland
and

again
briefly
Croatia
Adaptation
process
and
catching
up
with
the
books
Seasons
A
Game
of
Thrones
A
Clash
of
Kings
A
Storm
of
Swords
As
of
five
books
have
been
published
in
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
and
author
George
RR
Martin
has
predicted
that
there
will
be
two
more
though
he
is
struggling
not
to
let
the
final
book
run
long
in
which
case
it
would
have
to
be
split
for
a
total
of
eight
books
The
third
novel
A
Storm
of
Swords
was
so
long
that
it
pushed
the
limits
of
how
large
a
published
book
could
physically
be
without
pages
falling
out
Because
the
third
novel
was
so
long
the
production
team
realized
it
would
be
impossible
to
condense
it
all
into
a
single
season
so
the
decision
was
made
to
adapt
its
contents
across
two
seasons
While
Season
ends
with
the
Red
Wedding
this
actually
happened
in
the
middle
of
the
third
novel
similar
to
how
Renly
Baratheon
suddenly
died
in
the
middle
of
Season
Jon
Snow
returned
to
Castle
Black
by
the
middle
of
the
third
novel
Daenerys
Targaryen
had
not
yet
reached
Meereen
by
the
middle
of
the
third
novel
A
few
characters
did
advance
further
than
this
in
Season
ie
Bran
Stark
actually
passed
north
of
the
Wall
at
the
end
of
the
third
novel
he
had
so
few
chapters
in
the
entire
book
that
the
TV
producers
didnt
want
to
space
it
out
for
two
full
seasons
By
the
end
of
the
fourth
season
most
of
the
characters
had
completed
their
story
from
the
third
novel
Season
and
Intercutting
A
Feast
for
Crows
A
Dance
with
Dragons
What
was
originally
planned
as
the
fourth
novel
was
even
longer
than
the
third
novel
so
Martin
split
it
into
two
novels
A
Feast
for
Crows
the
fourth
book
and
A
Dance
with
Dragons
the
fifth
book
The
fourth
and
fifth
books
occur
during
a
simultaneous
timeframe
all
of
the
chapters
set
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
moved
to
the
fourth
book
while
all
chapters
set
outside
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
at
the
Wall
or
across
the
Narrow
Sea
in
Essos
were
moved
to
the
fifth
book
Though
of
course
despite
splitting
them
because
as
one
book
they
would
have
been
longer
than
the
third
novel
Martin
kept
making
additions
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
novels
during
the
writing
process
so
both
are
nearly
as
long
as
the
third
novel
It
would
be
odd
to
spend
an
entire
season
with
one
set
of
characters
while
the
rest
do
not
appear
then
reverse
this
in
the
subsequent
season
So
Seasons
chronologically
presented
events
in
the
order
that
they
happened
This
is
comparable
to
how
JRR
Tolkiens
The
Two
Towers
actually
consisted
of
two
halves
the
first
half
entirely
follows
Aragorn
since
the
end
of
the
first
novel
then
the
second
half
backs
up
in
time
to
follow
only
Frodos
perspective
but
during
the
same
timeframe
since
the
end
of
the
first
novel
Peter
Jacksons
movie
adaptation
however
chose
to
simply
intercut
between
the
two
storylines
to
show
events
in
the
chronological
order
in
which
they
occurred
Thus
Season
consisted
of
the
majority
of
the
material
fromA
Feast
for
Crows
and
A
Dance
with
Dragons
Seasons
and
Beyond
the
books
Given
that
there
are
currently
five
novels
with
the
third
split
into
two
seasons
but
given
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
novels
have
been
adapted
in
season
and
there
was
only
a
very
limited
amount
of
material
left
to
be
adapted
Even
so
Martin
has
told
producers
Benioff
Weiss
the
general
outline
of
how
the
final
two
books
are
going
to
progress
so
if
a
bolt
of
lightning
strikes
Martin
theyd
still
be
able
to
finish
according
to
Martins
general
plan
As
a
result
the
total
amount
of
seasons
remained
unclear
for
quite
some
time
During
Season
in
an
interview
with
Mother
Jones
magazine
Benioff
Weiss
said
that
they
thought
the
TV
series
might
run
as
many
as
eight
seasons
for
a
total
of
episodes
though
they
were
unsure
Mother
Jones
So
I
gather
that
Game
of
Thrones
could
last
eight
or
nine
seasons
Does
that
mean
putting
novel
writing
on
hold
for
a
decade
Benioff
Weiss
Yes
if
we
live
that
long
and
HBO
keeps
wanting
to
make
the
show
We
have
the
opportunity
here
to
tell
a
coherent
story
that
lasts
for
hours
And
while
a
canvas
of
that
size
presents
all
sorts
of
storytelling
problems
it
also
allows
us
to
spend
more
time
with
these
characters
we
love
than
well
ever
get
again
Soon
before
Season
began
however
in
early
March
executive
producers
David
Benioff
and
Dan
Weiss
made
several
comments
that
they
actually
felt
Season
was
the
midway
point
of
the
TV
series
which
would
probably
last
seven
seasons
On
March
they
said
in
Entertainment
Weekly
It
feels
like
this
is
the
midpoint
for
usIf
were
going
to
go
seven
seasons
which
is
the
plan
Season
is
right
down
the
middle
the
pivot
pointI
would
say
its
the
goal
weve
had
from
the
beginningIt
was
our
unstated
goal
because
to
start
on
a
show
and
say
your
goal
is
seven
seasons
is
the
height
of
lunacy
Once
we
got
to
the
point
where
we
felt
like
were
going
to
be
able
to
tell
this
tale
to
its
conclusion
that
became
an
even
clearer
goal
Seven
gods
seven
kingdoms
seven
seasons
It
feels
right
to
us
The
repeated
statements
Benioff
and
Weiss
made
throughout
Season
that
they
always
intended
for
there
to
be
seven
seasons
simply
contradict
previous
statements
they
made
in
formal
print
interviews
such
as
with
Mother
Jones
in
though
plans
can
and
do
change
over
many
years
Benioff
Weiss
as
well
as
George
RR
Martin
himself
then
provided
comments
for
the
April
issue
of
Vanity
Fair
which
was
released
about
two
weeks
after
Benioff
and
Weiss
said
in
Entertainment
Weekly
that
there
might
be
only
seven
seasons
Contradicting
his
statements
made
at
the
same
time
in
EW
that
were
going
for
seven
seasons
its
been
our
goal
since
the
beginning
Benioff
instead
repeated
that
the
production
team
wasnt
sure
if
the
TV
series
would
last
seven
or
eight
seasons
If
were
a
series
and
were
four
seasons
five
seasons
in
and
its
indefinite
as
to
how
long
its
gonna
go
then
I
dont
think
theres
as
much
pressure
as
far
as
the
end
is
coming
the
end
is
nigh
So
for
us
whether
it
ends
up
being
seven
or
eight
its
right
around
there
I
think
weve
always
felt
we
just
completed
the
fourth
season
this
is
the
midpoint
And
were
coming
around
the
bend
right
now
DB
Weiss
also
said
in
Vanity
Fair
after
they
had
just
finished
Season
and
were
about
to
start
writing
Season
that
they
saw
the
show
as
running
up
to
eight
seasons
We
know
theres
an
end
somewhere
in
the
sevenoreight
season
zone
Its
not
something
that
goes
ten
eleven
it
doesnt
just
keep
on
going
because
it
can
I
think
the
desire
to
milk
more
out
of
it
is
what
would
eventually
kill
it
if
we
gave
in
to
that
Elio
and
Linda
of
Westerosorg
analyzed
these
conflicting
statements
before
Season
began
and
offered
an
explanation
most
TV
series
do
not
make
their
starring
cast
members
sign
contracts
which
last
longer
than
six
years
If
a
TV
show
is
successful
enough
that
it
lasts
longer
than
six
years
the
starring
cast
members
can
renegotiate
their
contracts
and
because
the
show
is
now
a
guaranteed
hit
their
pay
can
increase
drastically
A
starring
cast
member
on
a
longrunning
and
popular
TV
series
can
easily
leave
the
show
after
the
sixth
season
and
enter
into
a
lucrative
film
career
being
paid
millions
of
dollars
instead
of
the
several
hundred
thousand
that
a
TV
series
can
easily
afford
to
pay
them
in
the
same
time
period
A
hit
TV
series
might
be
popular
enough
and
generate
enough
revenue
to
sustain
this
but
the
Game
of
Thrones
producers
have
no
way
of
completely
guaranteeing
that
the
TV
seriess
ratings
will
be
as
high
three
seasons
in
the
future
As
a
result
in
Season
the
executive
producers
started
backtracking
and
saying
that
they
had
always
intended
for
only
seven
seasons
because
they
were
in
heavy
contract
negotiations
between
the
starring
cast
and
HBO
Now
unsure
if
they
would
have
more
than
seven
seasons
even
though
they
had
previously
said
they
felt
they
needed
at
least
eight
to
tell
the
story
in
full
they
didnt
want
to
promise
more
than
they
could
confirm
Westerosorg
therefore
theorized
that
going
into
Season
the
writers
were
adapting
to
a
worst
case
scenario
mode
for
the
event
that
they
only
had
seven
seasons
This
included
drastically
cutting
several
major
subplots
from
the
novels
such
as
omitting
House
Greyjoys
subplots
almost
entirely
not
making
mention
of
Doran
Martells
other
children
including
his
daughter
and
heir
Arianne
and
cutting
out
many
major
characters
that
appear
in
Tyrion
Lannisters
storyline
in
the
Free
Cities
They
went
on
to
speculate
however
that
once
Season
had
finished
production
the
TV
writers
would
probably
know
how
the
cast
contract
negotiations
worked
out
and
if
it
was
indeed
confirmed
that
they
would
get
more
than
seven
seasons
they
would
then
restructure
accordingly
ie
not
omitting
these
storylines
but
pushing
them
back
to
Season
As
events
unfolded
it
was
announced
in
October
that
HBO
was
indeed
able
to
reach
a
settlement
with
the
starring
cast
members
based
on
the
unprecedented
and
continued
success
of
the
TV
series
HBO
agreed
to
give
them
all
major
pay
raises
Part
of
this
involved
instituting
a
paygrade
system
while
it
a
large
ensemble
cast
a
few
cast
members
who
can
arguably
be
called
the
core
cast
These
Tier
A
cast
members
as
they
called
them
were
Peter
Dinklage
Tyrion
Lannister
Lena
Headey
Cersei
Lannister
Nikolaj
CosterWaldau
Jaime
Lannister
Kit
Harington
Jon
Snow
and
Emilia
Clarke
Daenerys
Targaryen
Maisie
Williams
Arya
Stark
and
Sophie
Turner
Sansa
Stark
are
not
in
the
Tier
A
cast
it
is
possible
they
arent
paid
as
much
due
to
being
underaged
A
later
interview
with
Entertainment
Weekly
in
March
reported
that
for
Season
the
Tier
A
cast
members
were
each
paid
per
episode
As
predicted
with
these
cast
contract
renegotiations
settled
HBO
and
the
writers
began
intimating
that
the
TV
series
could
run
for
more
than
seven
seasons
In
the
same
Entertainment
Weekly
interview
HBO
programming
president
Michael
Lombardo
said
that
the
network
would
eagerly
accept
the
TV
series
going
on
for
eight
to
ten
seasons
but
only
if
writers
Benioff
and
Weiss
felt
it
served
the
story
instead
of
dragging
it
out
though
of
course
the
TV
series
has
not
been
padding
the
massive
novels
series
but
omitting
many
subplots
for
time
Lombardo
said
Well
have
an
honest
conversation
that
explores
all
possible
avenues
If
they
Benioff
and
Weiss
werent
comfortable
going
beyond
seven
seasons
I
trust
them
implicitly
and
trust
thats
the
right
decisionas
horrifying
as
that
is
to
me
What
Im
not
going
to
do
is
have
a
show
continue
past
where
the
creators
believe
where
they
feel
theyve
finished
with
the
story
Westerosorg
WatchersOnTheWallcom
and
Entertainment
Weekly
all
agreed
that
what
increasingly
seems
most
probable
is
that
like
other
major
TV
series
such
as
Mad
Men
Game
of
Thrones
will
probably
end
with
a
doublesized
seventh
season
which
is
then
split
into
two
halves
and
aired
a
year
apart
ie
episodes
instead
of
broken
into
two
episode
blocks
This
would
functionally
result
in
the
TV
series
getting
eight
seasons
though
for
purposes
of
prohibitively
expensive
cast
contract
negotiations
it
technically
wouldnt
count
as
another
full
season
Benioff
and
Weiss
also
noted
in
the
March
Entertainmenet
Weekly
interview
that
the
pay
issue
has
largely
been
solved
after
successful
negotiations
and
the
series
continues
to
bring
in
revenue
with
high
ratings
but
the
major
issue
they
deal
with
now
is
the
time
issue
Game
of
Thrones
is
one
of
the
largest
TV
productions
in
history
spanning
multiple
countries
with
different
units
filming
simultaneously
and
the
shooting
schedule
for
Season
officially
lasted
a
massive
days
As
they
have
said
before
they
physically
cannot
hope
to
produce
more
than
episodes
at
such
high
quality
in
a
single
year
and
the
scale
keeps
increasing
with
an
everexpanding
cast
and
new
set
locations
As
Weiss
said
The
money
issue
was
largely
supplanted
by
the
time
issue
Theres
still
the
money
issue
since
television
budgets
are
not
movie
budgets
youre
always
making
Sophies
choices
in
terms
of
visual
effects
We
ran
up
against
the
absolute
limit
of
how
many
days
we
can
shoot
in
a
year
On
July
HBO
programming
president
Michael
Lombardo
announced
that
the
TV
series
will
last
at
least
eight
seasons
not
only
seven
Speaking
at
the
Television
Critics
Association
press
tour
Lombardo
said
that
while
Season
was
not
yet
technically
ordered
HBO
and
the
writing
team
felt
that
there
were
about
two
more
seasons
worth
of
story
matching
the
expectation
that
it
is
based
on
a
series
of
seven
novels
one
of
which
was
so
large
it
was
split
and
adapted
as
two
TV
seasons
In
contrast
with
Benioff
and
Weisss
frequent
declarations
since
Season
that
they
had
always
intended
for
there
to
be
seven
TV
seasons
though
they
had
repeatedly
said
seven
or
eight
before
Season
Lombardo
said
that
Sevenseasonsandout
has
never
been
the
internal
conversation
between
the
production
team
and
HBO
Lombardo
said
The
question
is
How
much
beyond
seven
are
we
going
to
do
Obviously
were
shooting
six
now
hopefully
discussing
seven
Showrunners
David
Benioff
and
Dan
Weiss
are
feel
like
theres
two
more
years
after
six
I
would
always
love
for
them
to
change
their
minds
but
thats
what
were
looking
at
right
now
Lombardo
also
directly
reiterated
that
HBO
is
interested
in
making
prequel
projects
adapted
from
Martins
other
stories
set
in
Westeros
ie
the
Tales
of
Dunk
and
Egg
but
he
also
reiterated
that
they
arent
going
to
have
any
serious
negotiations
about
prequel
projects
until
after
the
main
TV
series
is
over
due
to
the
massive
amount
of
work
involved
On
April
David
Benioff
estimated
they
had
episodes
left
after
season
six
Were
heading
into
the
final
lap
he
said
Thats
the
guess
though
nothing
is
yet
set
in
stone
but
thats
what
were
looking
at
Presumably
season
seven
would
have
that
number
of
episodes
and
season
eight
would
be
six
episodes
Weiss
and
Benioff
said
they
were
unable
continuing
to
produce
ten
episodes
of
the
show
in
the
previous
to
month
time
frame
Its
crossing
out
of
a
television
schedule
into
more
of
a
midrange
movie
schedule
Weiss
said
Catching
up
with
the
books
George
RR
Martin
himself
in
the
same
April
issue
of
Vanity
Fair
addressed
the
major
and
related
question
which
is
frequently
asked
what
will
happen
if
the
TV
series
outpaces
the
remaining
books
What
if
Martin
cannot
finish
the
next
novel
the
sixth
The
Winds
of
Winter
before
Season
has
to
enter
production
Martin
stated
that
while
he
is
trying
to
focus
on
writing
the
remaining
novels
he
is
opposed
to
rushing
them
to
finish
to
match
the
TV
series
given
that
he
wants
his
novels
to
stand
the
test
of
time
for
decades
like
JRR
Tolkiens
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
Thus
while
Martin
is
hurrying
he
has
accepted
that
it
a
real
possibility
that
he
cannot
finish
the
next
two
novels
in
time
admitting
on
his
personal
blog
that
the
show
would
catch
up
with
him
starting
season
Martin
declined
writing
an
episode
for
Season
and
Season
to
focus
on
writing
The
Winds
of
Winter
and
in
March
canceled
all
of
his
future
convention
appearances
to
focus
on
writing
it
Even
so
it
now
appears
all
but
certain
that
the
final
seasons
of
the
TV
series
will
probably
be
released
before
the
final
novel
A

Spring
Casting

For

The
series
is
set
in
a
world
where
the
seasons
can
last
for
years
at
a
time
The
main
setting
is
the
continent
of
Westeros
which
was
home
to
seven
feuding
kingdoms
until
they
were
united
by
the
Targaryen
family
using
dragons
some
three
centuries
ago
The
dragons
died
out
and
the
Targaryen
Mad
King
was
unseated
in
a
civil
war
led
by
Lords
Robert
Baratheon
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Hoster
Tully
seventeen
years
before
the
series
opens
Robert
has
ruled
as
King
ever
since
but
when
the
series
opens
his
rule
is
increasingly
undermined
by
other
factions
At
the
same
time
the
only
two
known
surviving
Targaryen
children
Viserys
and
Daenerys
having
grown
to
adulthood
in
exile
on
the
eastern
continent
of
Essos
are
now
planning
to
return
to
Westeros
and
retake
the
Iron
Throne
and
to
this
end
are
seeking
military
alliances
with
other
factions
As
both
civil
war
and
an
external
invasion
threaten
Westeros
another
danger
arises
in
the
lands
to
the
far
north
beyond
the
vast
Wall
that
forms
the
realms
northern
border
where
a
supernatural
threat
believed
to
be
mythical
seems
to
be
stirring
after
millennia
of
sleep
The
only
defense
lies
with
the
Nights
Watch
an
undermanned
underfunded
order
of
soldiers
once
held
in
honor
but
now
used
as
a
dumping
ground
for
criminals
and
exiles
The
Great
Houses
Westeros
is
ruled
by
nine
Great
Houses
who
in
turn
command
hundreds

lesser
vassal
houses
Houses
Stark

In
an
interview
with
New
York
Observer
just
before
Season
began
Bryan
Cogman
explained
the
writing
process
for
the
TV
series
Its
varied
from
season
to
season
as
we
figured
out
how
this
thing
works
But
its
basically
run
the
same
way
the
past
few
years
As
were
shooting
one
season
were
trading
emails
andor
chatting
on
set
about
the
broad
strokes
of
the
next
season
Character
X
starts
at
blank
and
we
want
him
or
her
to
end
up
at
blank
Then
as
we
start
to
approach
the
end
of
production
David
and
Dan
in
some
years
will
assign
the
various
writers
a
few
characters
For
instance
when
we
were
working
on
Season
I
was
assigned
Arya
and
a
few
others
So
Id
go
home
and
work
for
a
few
weeks
on
my
Arya
Season
keeping
in
mind
a
few
scenes
wed
already
discussed
and
what
chapters
and
scenarios
and
themes
from
the
books
we
might
use
Then
in
January
when
were
back
in
LA
wed
meet
for
about
two
or
three
weeks
armed
with
the
work
wed
all
done
individually
and
throw
it
all
up
on
the
board
You
debate
you
use
some
stuff
you
throw
some
stuff
out
you
think
up
some
new
stuff
Sometimes
what
you
end
up
with
is
really
close
to
the
individual
outlines
Sometimes
its
very
different
After
we
map
out
all
the
main
characters
individual
arcs
using
colorcoded
index
cards
we
arrange
them
by
episode
and
get
a
rough
idea
of
the
scene
order
From
there
we
all
split
up
again
and
each
tackle
a
chunk
of
the
outlinea
detailed
outline
which
sometimes
ends
up
being
over
a
hundred
pages
David
and
Dan
polish
it
and
thats
what
we
use
to
script
our
episodes
Im
generally
assigned
midseason
episodesit
just
seems
to
work
out
that
way
George
wrote
a
script
per
season
for
the
first
four
seasons
but
took
a
break
for
Season
as
hes
hard
at
work
on
the
next
book
And
while
George
isnt
in
the
writers
room
he
reads
the
outlines
and
gives
his
notes
From
there
I
write
my
two
scriptsit
takes
me
about
a
month
and
half
to
do
bothDD
read
them
give
notes
I
do
a
rewrite
DD
sometimes
do
a
pass
on
it
themselves
And
we
continue
to
tinker
with
all
of
the
scripts
through
prep
and
production
But
theyre
generally
cameraready
when
we
finish
them
They
have
to
be
as
we
have
to
have
all
scripts
complete
well
before
shooting
starts
We
shoot
all
episodes
simultaneously
out
of
order
like
a
big
hour
movie
with
two
shooting
units
going
at
all
times
sometimes
in
different
countries
Cogman
went
on
to
explain
that
as
of
Season
there
were
never
more
than
four
people
in
the
writers
room
at
any
one
time
Martin
didnt
actually
sit
in
the
writers
room
even
when
he
wrote
one
episode
each
year
in
Seasons
to
he
didnt
move
to
Northern
Ireland
to
oversee
filming
for
months
at
a
time
the
way
they
did
though
they
sent
him
their
outlines
and
he
would
send
them
back
with
notes
In
Season
the
only
three
people
sitting
in
the
writers
room
and
discussing
the
scripts
were
Benioff
Weiss
and
Cogman
Jane
Espenson
wrote
one
episode
in
Season
but
as
she
has
explained
they
gave
her
a
copy
of
the
book
filled
with
stickit
notes
and
strict
instructions
to
adapt
a
certain
page
range
but
she
was
not
actively
contributing
on
the
rest
of
the
season
as
a
whole
and
left
after
Season
In
Season
Vanessa
Taylor
joined
the
show
and
became
the
fourth
person
and
only
woman
sitting
in
the
writers
room
discussions
Taylor
stayed
through
Season
but
did
not
return
for
Season
and
in
Season
assistant
Dave
Hill
was
promoted
up
to
be
a
new
full
staff
writer
bringing
the
number
of
people
in
the
room
back
up
to
four
Cogman
said
that
he
felt
having
such
a
small
number
of
writers
helped
keep
the
show
more
focused

History
Background
House
Greyjoy
is
one
of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros
Their
lands
are
the
Iron
Islands
off
the
west
coast
of
the
continent
They
rule
from
their
castle
Pyke
from
the
island
of
the
same
name
The
Iron
Islands
are
harsh
and
bleak
and
the
Greyjoys
have
traditionally
survived
by
raiding
their
neighbors
They
have
always
had
plans
to
conquer
the
mainland
The
head
of
the
house
is
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke
House
Greyjoy
boasts
descent
from
the
Grey
King
a
legendary
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
said
to
have
ruled
for
a
thousand
years
and
taken
a
mermaid
as
his
wife
Like
the
vast
majority
of
ironborn
they
worship
theDrowned
God
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
was
the
founder
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
Iron
Islands
He
led
a
rebellion
against
King
Robert
Baratheon
eight
years
before
the
events
of
the
series
begin
Balons
sons
Rodrik
and
Maron
were
killed
in
the
unsuccessful
rebellion
Balons
only
surviving
son
Theon
was
made
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
to
ensure
Balons
submission
to
King
Robert
Only
his
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
and
two
of
his
brothers
remained
on
the
Iron
Islands
after
his
defeat
At
some
point
Balon
exiled
his
younger
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
who
became
a
feared
pirate
that
terrorized
the
seas
as
far
as
from
Oldtown
in
Westeros
to
Qarth
in
Essos
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
is
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
He
lives
at
the
Stark
castle
of
Winterfell
where
he
has
a
cordial
relationship
with
his
Stark
hosts
Despite
the
respectful
treatment
accorded
by
the
Starks
Theon
is
insecure
about
his
status
as
a
ward
He
boasts
of
his
status
as
a
lord
to
Osha
a
Wildling
servant
in
the
Stark
household
but
fails
to
intimidate
her
He
later
accompanies
Neds
son
Robb
Stark
the
King
in
the
North
to
fight
in
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
and
wins
Robbs
trust
and
favor
Season
Theon
appeals
to
King
Robb
to
send
him
on
a
mission
to
negotiate
an
alliance
with
his
father
Balon
Greyjoy
reasoning
that
the
Starks
would
need
ships
to
attack
Kings
Landing
Despite
Catelyn
Starks
distrust
of
Balon
Robb
relents
and
sends
Theon
back
to
the
Iron
Islands
to
secure
help
However
Balon
has
other
ideas
and
plans
to
use
the
power
struggle
on
the
mainland
to
carve
up
a
kingdom
in
the
North
once
more
declaring
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
is
torn
between
his
birth
family
and
his
loyalty
to
the
Starks
but
ultimately
chooses
to
submit
to
his
father
Theon
decides
to
renege
his
allegiance
to
the
Starks
and
is
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Drowned
God
while
his
father
and
sister
watch
on
Balons
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
leads
a
large
force
that
attacks
Deepwood
Motte
the
seat
of
House
Glover
Meanwhile
Theon
is
made
the
commander
of
the
Sea
Bitch
Instead
of
attacking
small
fishing
villages
as
ordered
Theon
and
his
men
raid
Torrhens
Square
and
succeed
in
drawing
the
remaining
Stark
forces
away
from
Winterfell
Without
consulting
Balon
or
Yara
Theon
and
his
men
seize
Winterfell
and
capture
Neds
younger
sons
Bran
and
Rickon
Stark
Theon
also
executes
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
for
defying
him
However
the
two
Stark
boys
and
their
Direwolves
escape
with
the
help
of
Osha
and
Hodor
In
retaliation
Theon
murders
two
orphans
and
claims
them
as
Bran
and
Rickon
His
actions
have
the
effect
of
fuelling
northern
hostility
towards
the
Ironborn
invaders
Balon
and
Yara
are
furious
with
Theons
conduct
which
has
jeopardized
the
Ironborn
war
effort
Yara
leads
a
party
to
implore
her
brother
to
leave
Winterfell
Theon
refuses
and
insists
on
defending
his
prize
against
the
northerners
Unable
to
reason
with
Theon
Yara
is
forced
to
leave
him
behind
Theon
and
his
paltry
garrison
are
besieged
by
a
large
Bolton
army
led
by
Ramsay
Snow
the
bastard
son
of
Roose
Bolton
a
vassal
of
the
Starks
The
Ironborn
turn
on
Theon
and
hand
him
over
to
Ramsay
in
return
for
safe
conduct
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
flays
them
alive
The
capture
of
Theon
is
a
major
blow
to
House
Greyjoy
since
it
deprives
Balon
of
his
last
remaining
son
and
heir
to
the
Seastone
Chair
Season
Over
a
prolonged
period
Theon
Greyjoy
is
tortured
and
emasculated
by
Ramsay
Snow
Due
to
his
experiences
Theon
adopts
the
persona
Reek
and
becomes
totally
subjugated
to
Ramsay
Theon
later
issues
an
ultimatum
to
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
demanding
that
he
withdraw
his
forces
from
the
North
Ramsay
also
threatens
to
send
more
bits
of
his
son
Theon
and
to
flay
every
Ironborn
in
the
North
alive
if
his
demands
are
not
met
As
a
parting
gift
Ramsay
also
presents
Theons
severed
penis
Unwilling
to
abandon
the
strongholds
he
has
taken
Balon
rejects
Ramsays
demands
He
also
rejects
his

wishes
Yara
assembles
a
team
of
Ironborn
warriors
to
rescue
her
brother

Season
Theon
Greyjoy
has
seemingly
forgotten
his
former
identity
and
embraced
the
persona
Reek
He
is
totally
subservient
to
his
master
Ramsay
Upon
returning
to
the
Dreadfort
Roose
Bolton
reprimands
his
son
Ramsay
for
torturing
and
emasculating
Theon
As
Balons
son
and
heir
he
would
have
been
a
valuable
hostage
for
him
to
trade
with
Balon
in
return
for
securing
the
withdrawal
of
Ironborn
forces
from
the
North
Later
Yara
and
her
warriors
manage
to
infiltrate
the
Dreadfort

cell
However
fearing
that
it
is
another
trap
set
up
by
his
master
Theon
spurns
Yaras
offer
Yara
and
her
warriors
are
forced
to
flee
when
Ramsay
unleashes
his
dogs
on
them
After
reaching
their
boats
Yara
regards
her
brother
Theon
to
be
dead
Having
proven
his
loyalty
Reek
is
sent
on
a
mission
by
Ramsay
to
secure
the
surrender
of
the
Ironborn
garrison
at
Moat
Cailin
For
this
mission
Reek
has
to
pretend
to
be
Theon
Identifying
himself
as
Theon
and
Balons
last
remaining
heir
Reek
addresses
the
Ironborn
garrison
telling
them
to
surrender
in
return
for
safe
passage
Despite
being
met
by
resistance
from
the
garrison
commander
Ralf
Kenning
his
men
accept
Theons
offer
and
surrender
to
the
Boltons
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
has
them
flayed
alive
anyway
Season

of
the
two

claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
At
the

A
gelding
knife
employed
by
Ramsay
Snow
the
TV
seriess
props
department
based
it
on
the
design
of
reallife
medieval
gelding
knives
This
is
mercy
Im
not
killing
you
just
making
a

Ramsay

Theon
Greyjoysrc
Eunuchs
are
men
who
have
had
their
testicles
removed
in
order
to
make
them
more
efficient
servants
or
soldiers
as
they
are
not
distracted
by
lust
or
sexual
matters
The
practice
is
considered
cruel
in
Westeros
where
eunuchs
are
mistrusted
men
are
typically
only
castrated
or
gelded
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
as
punishment
for
serious
crimes
such
as
rape
It
may
also
be
employed
as
a
means
of
physical
or
psychological
torture
However
it
is
considered
acceptable
in
many
parts
of
Essos
as
part
of
the
vibrant
slave
trade
which
exists
in
many
areas
Slaveeunuchs
are
a
common
sight
in
Essos
and
the
famous
warrioreunuchs
produced
in
Slavers
Bay
known
as
the
Unsullied
are
among
the
most
disciplined
soldiers
in
the
known
world
Note
When
a
male
has
his
testicles
removed
the
term
is
castration
When
a
male
has
his
testicles
and
also
the
shaft
of
his
penis
removed
the
term
is
emasculation
Colloquially
however
both
practices
tend
to
be
referred
to
as
castration
Contentsshow
In
the
series
Season
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
expresses
distrust
of
and
disgust
with
Varys
and
is
annoyed
that
a
eunuch
is
serving
on
the
kings
small
council
When
discussing
the
death
of
Jon
Arryn
Pycelle
suggests
that
poison
is
a
weapon
typically
used
by
women
and
also
eunuchs
He
then
bluntly
notes
that
Varys
is
a
eunuch
trying
to
throw
suspicion
on
him
Petyr
Baelish
talks
to
Varys
about
his
disfigurement
as
part
of
a
verbal
sparring
match
asking
where
his
testicles
are
located
He
notes
that
Varys
is

the
story
of
how
he
was
emasculated
to
Tyrion

A

his

both

burned
them

only
spears
shields
and
spiked
helms
Jorah
Mormont
describes
the
Unsullied
at
the
Battle
of
Qohorsrc
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
different
regions
are
known
to
make
eunuchs
in
different
ways
Some
only
remove
the
testicles
but
leave
the
shaft
of
the
penis
intact
while
others
remove
all
external
genitalia
both
the
penis
and
testicles
The
slavercity
of
Yunkai
for
example
is
known
to
make
eunuchs
by
removing
only
a
slaves
testicles
but
the
slavemasters
of
Astapor
make
eunuchs
by
removing
everything
penis
and
testes
such
as
when
they
make
the
Unsullied
A
eunuch
with
only
the
testicles
removed
but
not
the
penis
will
still
lose
the
will
to
partake
of
sexual
activity
but
other
slavemasters
like
to
be
sure
by
removing
the
penis
as
well
In
real
life
if
an
adult
man
has
his
testicles
removed
he
can
still
achieve
an
erection
If
a
boy
has
his
testicles
removed
before
puberty
however
it
is
difficult
to
impossible
for
them
to
achieve
an
erection
with
the
remaining
shaft
of
the
penis
due
to
the
lack
of
hormones
during
the
puberty
years
that
would
normally
be
supplied
by
the
testicles
This
is
a
moot
point
for
the
Unsullied
both
their
testicles
and
penis
shaft
are
removed
when
they
are
no
more
than
five
years
old
Kraznys
actually
explains
within
the
novels
that
eunuchs
can
sometimes
achieve
an
erection
if
they
only
have
their
testicles
removed
so
this
is
why
the
Astapori
cut
off
all
of
the
Unsullieds
genitals
just
to
be
sure

Daenerys

meets
with

so
they

The
dosh
khaleen
are
a
ruling
group
within
the
Dothraki
social
hierarchy
specifically
the
crones
who
preside
over
the
holy
city
of
Vaes
Dothrak
The
dosh
khaleen
are
composed
of
the
widows
of
slain
khals
and
serve
as
seers
foretelling
the
future
and
interpreting
omens
for
the
Dothraki
In
this
capacity
they
essentially
also
serve
as
the
leaders
of
the
Dothraki
religion
Even
powerful
khals
and
fierce
male
Dothraki
warriors
fear
disobeying
the
will
of
the
dosh
khaleen
The
name
dosh
khaleen
literally
means
council
of
crones
in
the
Dothraki
language
Each
one
of
them
was
formerly
the
wife
of
a
khal
and
thus
each
of
them
was
once
a
khaleesi
An
individual
member
of
the
group
would
be
called
a
khaleen

crone

History
Season
Daenerys
eats
a
Stallion
heart
in
a
ritual
conducted
by
the
dosh
khaleen
seen
behind
her
In
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
dosh
khaleen
to
eat
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
crones
can
read
the
omens
At
first
it
seems
she
wont
hold
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The
crones
declare
Daenerys
and
Drogos
son
will
be
The
Stallion
Who
Mounts
the
World
a
great
conqueror
whose
coming
is
long
foretold
in
Dothraki
history
Daenerys
says
his
name
will
be
Rhaego
after
her
brother
RhaegarTargaryen
who
wasslain
in
the
rebellion
byRobert
Baratheon
Season
After
being
captured
by
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
was
offered
to
Khal
Moro
as
a
gift
She
eventually
earned
the
respect
of
the
khal
after
explaining
to
him
that
she
was
Khal
Drogos
wife
However
instead
of
escorting
her
to
Meereen
as
per
her
request
Khal
Moros
wife
tells
her
that
she
must
remain
in
the
temple
of
Vaes
Dothrak
with
the
dosh
khaleen
for
the
rest
of
her
life
as
she
was
a
widow
of
a
khal
and
a
former
khaleesi
Daenerys
is
welcomed
to
the
Temple
by
the
High
Priestess
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
who
admonishes
her
for
not
returning
to
the
Temple
immediately
after
Khal
Drogos
death
She
relates
her
own
history
as
the
wife
of
Khal
Savo
to
connect
with
Daenerys
but
warns
her
that
because
she
violated
tradition
it
is
up
to
the
khals
assembling
for
the
Khalar
vezhven
to
decide
whether
Daenerys
will
join
their
ranks
Later
on
the
High
Priestess
clearly
hoping
that
Daenerys
will
be
allowed
to
stay
with
them
explains
the
politics
of
the
dosh
khaleen
and
that
some
of
them
dislike
Daenerys
and
her
obvious
Valyrian
features
thinking
that
the
Dothraki
shouldnt
breed
with
outsiders
The
high
priestess
dismisses
them
however
pointing
out
that
the
Dothraki
have
always
interbred
and
taken
outsiders
as
khaleesi
She
points
out
a
khaleen
of
Lhazareen
origin
to
illustrate
her
point
During
the
khalar
vezhven
the
dosh
khaleen
bring
Daenerys
before
the
Khals
to
be
judged
but
it
seems
they
are
barred
from
attending
themselves
The
Mother
of
Dragons
turns
the
tables
on
the
khals
and
destroys
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
killing
everyone
inside
The
dosh
khaleen
are
amongst
the
crowd
gathering
to
watch
the
conflagration
and
when
they
see
Daenerys
emerge
from
the
flames
unburnt
they
bow
with
the
rest

Daenerys
Targaryen
meets
with
the
dosh
khaleen
so
they
can
interpret
omens
about
her
child
The
dosh
khaleen
are
a
ruling
group
within
the
Dothraki
social
hierarchy
specifically
the
crones
who
preside
over
the
holy
city
of
Vaes
Dothrak
The
dosh
khaleen
are
composed
of
the
widows
of
slain
khals
and
serve
as
seers
foretelling
the
future
and
interpreting
omens
for
the
Dothraki
In
this
capacity
they
essentially
also
serve
as
the
leaders
of
the
Dothraki
religion
Even
powerful
khals
and
fierce
male
Dothraki
warriors
fear
disobeying
the
will
of
the
dosh
khaleen
The
name
dosh
khaleen
literally
means
council
of
crones
in
the
Dothraki
language
Each
one
of
them
was
formerly
the
wife
of
a
khal
and
thus
each
of
them
was
once
a
khaleesi
An
individual
member
of
the
group
would
be
called
a
khaleen
literally
crone

History
Season
Daenerys
eats
a
Stallion
heart
in
a
ritual
conducted
by
the
dosh
khaleen
seen
behind
her
In
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
dosh
khaleen
to
eat
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
crones
can
read
the
omens
At
first
it
seems
she
wont
hold
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The
crones
declare
Daenerys
and
Drogos
son
will
be
The
Stallion
Who
Mounts
the
World
a
great
conqueror
whose
coming
is
long
foretold
in
Dothraki
history
Daenerys
says
his
name
will
be
Rhaego
after
her
brother
RhaegarTargaryen
who
wasslain
in
the
rebellion
byRobert
Baratheon
Season
After
being
captured
by
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
was
offered
to
Khal
Moro
as
a
gift
She
eventually
earned
the
respect
of
the
khal
after
explaining
to
him
that
she
was
Khal
Drogos
wife
However
instead
of
escorting
her
to
Meereen
as
per
her
request
Khal
Moros
wife
tells
her
that
she
must
remain
in
the
temple
of
Vaes
Dothrak
with
the
dosh
khaleen
for
the
rest
of
her
life
as
she
was
a
widow
of
a
khal
and
a
former
khaleesi
Daenerys
is
welcomed
to
the
Temple
by
the
High
Priestess
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
who
admonishes
her
for
not
returning
to
the
Temple
immediately
after
Khal
Drogos
death
She
relates
her
own
history
as
the
wife
of
Khal
Savo
to
connect
with
Daenerys
but
warns
her
that
because
she
violated
tradition
it
is
up
to
the
khals
assembling
for
the
Khalar
vezhven
to
decide
whether
Daenerys
will
join
their
ranks
Later
on
the
High
Priestess
clearly
hoping
that
Daenerys
will
be
allowed
to
stay
with
them
explains
the
politics
of
the
dosh
khaleen
and
that
some
of
them
dislike
Daenerys
and
her
obvious
Valyrian
features
thinking
that
the
Dothraki
shouldnt
breed
with
outsiders
The
high
priestess
dismisses
them
however
pointing
out
that
the
Dothraki
have
always
interbred
and
taken
outsiders
as
khaleesi
She
points
out
a
khaleen
of
Lhazareen
origin
to
illustrate
her
point
During
the
khalar
vezhven
the
dosh
khaleen
bring
Daenerys
before
the
Khals
to
be
judged
but
it
seems
they
are
barred
from
attending
themselves
The
Mother
of
Dragons
turns
the
tables
on
the
khals
and
destroys
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
killing
everyone
inside
The
dosh
khaleen
are
amongst
the
crowd
gathering
to
watch
the
conflagration
and
when
they
see
Daenerys
emerge
from
the
flames
unburnt
they
bow
with
the
rest

Season
After

She
eventually
earned

However
instead
of

wife
tells
her
that
she
must
remain
in
the

of
Vaes
Dothrak
with

Daenerys
is
welcomed
to
the
Temple
by
the

of
the

Khaleen
who
admonishes
her
for
not

immediately
after

death
She
relates
her
own
history
as
the

dismisses
them
however
pointing

have
always
interbred

taken
outsiders
as

Biography
Background
Orsonwas
born
into
House
LannisterWhen
he
was
a
baby
a
wet
nursedropped
him
on
his
head
which
apparently
caused
brain
damage
and
left
him
simpleminded
for
all
of
his
life
His
relatives
would
regularly
laugh
at
him
due
to
his
handicap
amongthem
his
cousins
Tyrion
and
Jaime
Lannister
Tyrionadmits
that
he
only
laughed
at
Orson
because
for
a
moment
he
could
be
like
everyone
else
since
he
too
was
an
outcast
due
to
being
a
dwarf
He
would
regularly
smash
beetles
with
arock
in
the
gardens
leading
Tyrion
to
ask
him
why
to
which
Orson
only
replied
unintelligibly
Tyrion
then
observed
Orson
every
day
smashing
the
beetles
convinced
that
Orson
must
have
been
doing
it
for
a
reason
Since
Tyrion
considered
himself
to
be
the
smartest
person
he
knew
he
thought
he
could
discover
the
reason
for
his
cousins
behavior
Finding
the
answer
eventually
became
an
obsession
to
Tyrion
itgot
to
the
point
where
Tyrioncouldnot
sleep
having
nightmares
about
Orsons
relentless
beetle
slaughter
Tyrion
attempted
to
stop
Orson
from
smashing
any
more
beetles
but
since
Orson
was
twice
Tyrionssize
he
simply
pushed
Tyrion
away
and
continued
smashing
Orsonwas
eventually
kicked
in
the
chest
by
a
mule
and
died
leaving
the
question
of
why
he
was
smashing
all
the
beetles
unsolved
Season
While
Tyrion
is
waiting
in
his
prison
cell
for
the
Trial
by
combat
that
will
decide
his
fate
he
reminisces
with
Jaime
about
cousin
Orson
Tyrion
recalls
at
length
Orsons
slaughter
of
beetles
explaining
that
it
always
troubled
him
that
he
couldnt
discern
why
Orson
was
engaging
in
such
wanton
and
seemingly
random
destruction
Similarly
Tyrion
is
wondered
why
he
has
been
unjustly
targeted
and
may
soon
die
for
a
crime
he
did
not
commit
Tyrion
ponders
this
as
he
picks
up
a
beetle
he
found
in
his
cell
but
unlike
Orson
puts
it
back
down
and
leaves
it
unharmed

In
the
books
Inthe
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
there
is
no
such
character
nor
so
far
any
parallel
to
him
At
some
point
however
Tyrion
jokingly
mentions
that
his
father
kept
some
of
his
drooling
cousins
locked
in
the
bowels
of
Casterly
Rock
to
keep
them
from
shaming
the
family
The
only
book
character
by
that
name
is
Orson
Stone
a
sellsword
and
member
of
the
Windblown
mercenary
company
He
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
Lannistersis
not
feebleminded
and
has
no
habit
of
crushing
beetles
Tyrions
prolonged
discussion
of
Orson
lasts
nearly
four
minutes
in
The
Mountain
and
the
Viper
The
writers
explained
in
the
InsidetheEpisode
featurette
that
their
intention
was
that
faced
with
his
probable
death
Tyrions
mind
is
wandering
to
question
why
seemingly
random
acts
of
brutality
happen
in
the
world
and
that
he
saw
Orson
smashing
beetles
as
a
sort
of
microcosm
of
this
question
The
analogy
is
that
if
Orson
was
an
almighty
force
inflicting
death
and
destruction
on
insects
if
there
is
a
higher
power
inflicting
death
and
destruction
on
human
beings
whatever
god
gods
nature
or
fate
this
power
may
be
Tyrion
would
at
least
feel
better
knowing
there
was
some
underlying
reason
that
went
into
causing
such
brutality
He
also
wouldnt
be
particularly
upset
if
there
are
no
higher
powers
and
bad
things
truly
happen
at
random
But
Tyrion
felt
that
Orson
wasnt
acting
randomly
some
sort
of
decisionmaking
process
was
going
into
his
actions
though
he
could
not
discern
it
what
frightens
Tyrion
is
that
some
unknown
but
still
reasoning
thing
or
cosmic
powers
are
intentionally
directing
people
towards
death
and
destruction
yet
all
of
our
attempts
to
comprehend
why
they
are
doing
this
even
a
simple
reason
like
hate
are
in
vain
The
scene
is
very
similar
to
a
famous
one
from
the
Stanley
Kubrick
film
Paths
of
Glory
in
which
a
condemned
man
sees
a
cockroach
and
laments
Tomorrow
morning
well
be
dead
and
itll
be
alive
It
will
have
more
contact
with
my
wife
and
child
than
I
will
Ill
be
nothing
and
itll
be
alive
His
fellow
prisoner
then
crushes
the
cockroach
and
says
Now
youve
got
the
edge
on
him
While
Benioff
and
Weiss
didnt
explicitly
state
that
they
were
recalling
this
film
shortly
afterwards
they
mentioned
in
an
interview
about
the
battle
scene
for
the
very
next
episode
that
they
and
the
production
team
are
fans
of
Paths
of
Glory
and
used
it
as
a
visual
reference
for
certain
war
scenes
so
the
similarity
is
probably
not
coincidental
Its
possible
that
the
character
of
Orson
Lannister
is
a
jab
at
the
writer
Orson
Scott
Card
who
once
disparaged
the
show

A
map
showing
the
approximate
borders
of
the
Dothraki
Sea
on
the
continent
of
Essos
Note
that
the
Dothraki
range
far
beyond
the
lines
drawn
on
this
map
and
have
no
respect
for
national
boundaries
The
Dothraki
Sea
or
Great
Grass
Sea
is
a
region
on
the
continent
of
Essos
thousands
of
miles
to
the
east
of
Westeros
It
is
located
in
the
continental
interior
east
of
the
Free
Cities
and
is
a
vast
landscape
of
steppes
and
plains
covered
in
low
green
grass
which
makes
it
look
like
a
sea
from
afar
It
is
named
for
the
Dothraki
people
who
inhabit
it
horsemounted
warriors
who
migrate
across
the
plains
in
large
hordes
called
khalasars
each
of
which
may
contain
thousands
of
riders
to
plunder
neighboring
lands
Vaes
Dothrak
the
only
city
of
the
Dothraki
and
central
hub
of
their
society
lies
on
the
northeastern
edge
of
the
Dothraki
Sea
The
Dothraki
Sea
lies
north
of
Lhazar
Slavers
Bay
and
the
forbidding
Red
Waste
which
even
the
Dothraki
fear
to
cross
The
southern
border
is
loosely
marked
by
the
Skahazadhan
river
The
Red
Waste
protects
the
city
of
Qarth
from
Dothraki
attack
The
Dothraki
sea
stretches
almost
all
the
way
to
the
Jade
Sea
but
stops
short
due
to
intervening
mountains
and
forests
However
the
Dothraki
still
occasionally
raid
the
rich
cities
of
the
western
Jade
Sea
for
treasure
and
slaves
The
Dothraki
Sea
borders
the
Forest
of
Qohor
to
the
west
separating
it
from
the
Free
Cities
However
the
forest
does
not
present
a
significant
obstacle
to
their
hordes
which
frequently
threaten
the
Free
Cities
with
raids
or
to
exact
tribute
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Dothraki
Sea
is
east
of
the
Free
Cities
north
of
Lhazar
and
Slavers
Bay
and
northwest
of
the
Red
Waste
and
the
Jade
Sea
The
Dothraki
raid
surrounding
lands
from
the
sea
of
grass
plains
which
is
vast
and
takes
up
an
enormous
portion
of
explored
Essos
The
World
of
Ice
and
Fire
sourcebook
reveals
that
the
Dothraki
Sea
has
actually
been
home
to
a
number
of
advanced
cultures
throughout
history
from
the
unbelievably
ancient
Fisher
Queens
to
the
socalled
Kingdom
of
Sarnor
actually
a
patchwork
of
citystates
similar
to
the
ancient
Rhoynar
which
held
sway
during
the
rise
and
reign
of
Valyria
The
region
was
actually
heavily
developed
and
urbanized
for
much
of
the
time
following
the
Long
Night
During
the
Century
of
Blood
the
Dothraki
grew
in
strength
and
were
used
by
the
Sarnori
in
their
petty
wars
agains
each
other
By
the
time
they
realized
the
true
threat
it
was
too
late
and
the
Dothraki
eventually
destroyed
all
the
Sarnori
cities
including
the
library
city
of
Sallosh
which
contained
records
of
the
Sarnori
and
all
the
cultures
they
had
conquered
and
assimilated
over
the
centuries
The
Dothraki
also
destroyed
Essaria
the
Lost
Free
City
the
Ibbenese
colonies
on
the
north
coast
of
Essos
and
the
few
Qaathi
holdouts
that
had
not
been
swallowed
by
the
Red
Waste
Thus
the
entire
region
not
simply
the
grasslands
of
Sarnor
became
the
haunt
of
the
Dothraki
and
is
in
fact
dotted
with
the
slowly
overtaken
ruins
of
the
cities
that
came
before
Although
the
western
and
southern
boundaries
of
the
Dothraki
sea
are
somewhat
fluid
the
eastern
boundary
is
firm
as
the
grasslands
come
to
a
complete
stop
at
the
Bone
Mountains
which
the
Dothraki
for
the
most
part
cannot
cross

Being
a
lord
is
like
being
a
father
except
you
have
thousands
of
children
and
you
worry
about
them
all
the

Robb
Starksrc
The
social
and
political
structure
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
based
on
a
system
of
lords
and
lordship
in
which
political
power
is
dominated
by
noble
houses
In
turn
these
noble
houses
are
ruled
by
the
Great
Houses
who
are
sworn
to
the
King
of
the
Andals
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
The
system
of
lordship
may
have
been
introduced
in
Westeros
under
the
First
Men
though
its
final
form
was
achieved
after
the
Andals
invaded
the
continent
six
thousand
years
ago
In
ancient
times
every
hilllord
called
himself
a
king
but
over
the
centuries
the
stronger
petty
kingdoms
absorbed
the
weaker
ones
gradually
aggregating
into
larger
kingdoms
When
Aegon
I
Targaryen
began
his
invasion
of
Westeros
the
continent
was
divided
between
seven
large
kingdoms
The
Targaryen
Conquest
united
the
Seven
Kingdoms
into
a
single
realm
subordinate
to
the
Iron
Throne
Contentsshow
Social
structure
The
feudal
society
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
based
on
a
rigid
social
structure
dividing
the
population
between
a
hereditary
nobility
set
above
commoners
known
as
smallfolk
A
strict
political
hierarchy
is
in
place
consisting
of
kings
and
great
lords
who
command
the
allegiance
of
lesser
lords
who
serve
as
their
vassals
This
government
is
based
on
personal
oaths
of
allegiance
while
one
can
speak
of
the
realm
on
a
vague
level
they
do
not
possess
an
abstract
concept
of
the
Nationstate

modern
terms

inherits
all
of
their
parents
lands
and
possessions
to
the
exclusion
of
younger
siblings
This
is
in
contrast
to
a
system
of
partible
inheritance
in
which
lands
would
be
divided
evenly
among
siblings
upon
the
death
of
their
parents
As
George
RR
Martin
described
inheritance
in
Westeros
The
laws
of
inheritance
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
modelled
on
those
in
real
medieval
historywhich
is
to
say
they
were
vague
uncodified
subject
to
varying
interpretations
and
often
contradictoryHoldings
are
seldom
divided
Nor
are
they
combined
as
a
rule
although
one
person
could
conceivably
hold
more
than
one
title
The
other
major
factor
is
the
current
lord
if
one
decided
to
do
something
unusual
with
his
estates
that
would
carry
weight
Might
also
cause
disputes
though
The
designated
heir
in
line
of
succession
is
decided
by
birth
order
in
which
an
elder
brother
would
inherit
ahead
of
a
younger
brother
Many
heirs
will
still
try
to
provide
for
their
younger
siblings
giving
them
funds
to
live
on
or
minor
holdfasts
to
rule
over
in
their
name
For
example
Tywin
Lannister
inherited
all
of
his
fathers
holdings
while
his
younger
brother
Kevan
Lannister
inherited
no
lands
Even
so
Tywin
looks
out
for
his
family
and
has
rewarded
Kevan
with
substantial
wealth
over
the
years
for
his
loyal
service
However
this
is
a
matter
of
personal
preference
and
not
a
requirement
In
contrast
to
the
Lannisters
when
their
bannerman
Gregor
Clegane
succeeded
to
the
rule
of
House
Clegane
he
gave
absolutely
nothing
to
his
younger
brother
Sandor
at
which
Sandor
struck
out
on
his
own
to
seek
his
fortune
as
a
bodyguard
in
direct
service
to
the
Lannisters
The
other
major
rule
under
primogeniture
inheritance
law
is
that
a
lords
children
will
inherit
before
the
lords
younger
siblings
A
lords
younger
brother
will
only
inherit
once
his
older
brothers
bloodline
is
exhausted
leaving
no
surviving
children
or
grandchildren
Officially
if
a
lord
dies
leaving
an
infant
daughter
and
an
adult
younger
brother
his
infant
daughter
is
first
in
line
of
succession
In
practice
uncles
and
aunts
often
try
to
claim
inheritance
ahead
of
their
nephews
and
nieces
feeling
that
they
are
better
suited
to
rule
This
is
not
always
without
good
reason
as
a
noble
House
officially
led
by
an
infant
daughter
will
be
seen
as
weak
and
easy
to
attack
by
hostile
neighbors
There
have
been
many
instances
where
an
uncle
claimed
rule
ahead
of
infant
children
of
their
older
brother
and
indeed
had
widespread
support
and
truly
had
only
the
best
interests
of
the
familys
holdings
in
mind
Of
course
there
is
also
much
truth
to
the
trope
of
the
wicked
greedy
uncle
trying
to
cheat
the
rightful
heirs
out
of
the
family
lands
This
sort
of
situation
frequently
leads
to
succession
conflicts
Other
times
an
adult
daughter
or
a
child
son
may
be
deemed
unfit
to
rule
though
this
would
be
seen
as
a
stretch
by
many
of
their
vassals
if
the
only
surviving
child
is
not
only
an
infant
but
a
female
she
stands
the
highest
chance
of
having
her
succession
disputed
There
are
actually
three
different
variations
of
primogeniture
which
are
practiced
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Malepreference
Primogeniture
Andal
inheritance
law
followed
in
most
of
Westeros

click
to
expand
Commonly
known
as
simply
primogeniture
this
is
the
standard
inheritance
practice
throughout
almost
all
of
the
unified
realm
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
In
this
system
children
inherit
in
birth
order
but
daughters
are
counted
behind
sons
A
lords
daughter
would
still
inherit
ahead
of
his
own
younger
brother
because
his
bloodline
is
counted
ahead
of
his
brothers
bloodline
For
example
the
birth
order
in
the
current
generation
of
House
Stark
is
Robb
Sansa
Arya
Bran
Rickon
The
inheritance
order
however
is
Robb
Bran
Rickon
followed
by
Sansa
Arya
Thus
despite
the
fact
that
Sansa
is
the
secondborn
Stark
child
she
actually
follows
her
little
brother
Rickon
in
the
line
of
succession
As
the
children
of
a
lord
inherit
before
his
younger
siblings
if
Robb
Stark
were
ever
to
father
a
child
even
if
it
was
a
daughter
it
would
become
next
in
line
of
succession
ahead
of
Robbs
younger
brother
Bran
Thus
the
new
succession
order
would
be
Robb
Robbs
child
Bran
Rickon
Sansa
Arya
In
House
Lannister
Tywins
children
are
officially
in
the
line
of
succession
ahead
of
Tywins
younger
brother
Kevan
Normally
Jaime
Lannister
would
be
Tywins
legal
heir
but
he
forfeited
the
right
to
all
inheritance
when
he
joined
the
Kingsguard
which
also
requires
its
members
to
take
a
vow
of
celibacy
Normally
this
would
mean
that
Tyrion
Lannister
stands
ahead
of
his
sister
Cersei
in
line
of
succession
even
though
Tyrion
is
younger
than
Cersei
While
there
is
little
ambiguity
that
Tyrion
should
be
Tywins
heir
Tywin
despises
his
dwarf
son
so
much
that
he
has
never
acknowledged
Tyrion
as
his
legal
heir
a
gesture
normally
seen
as
a
mere
formality

Dorne
entered
the
Seven
Kingdoms
only
a
hundred
years
ago
not
through
conquest
but
through
marriagealliance
with
House
Martell
As
a
result
it
was
allowed
to
maintain
many
of
its
unique
local
customs
such
as
the
rulers
from
House
Martell
using
the
title
Prince
of
Dorne
instead
of
Lord
Paramount
of
Dorne
a
relic
from
the
time
Dorne
was
independent
and
from
past
centuries
when
the
Rhoynar
lived
in
riverbased
citystates
in
Essos
The
largest
practical
difference
in
their
laws
is
that
Dorne
was
allowed
to
continue
to
follow
equal
primogeniture
Under
equal
primogeniture
the
eldest
child
inherits
regardless
of
whether
they
are
male
or
female
Equal
primogeniture
is
practiced
by
all
of
the
noble
Houses
in
Dorne
including
the
ruling
Prince
of
Dorne
thus
when
a
woman
succeeds
to
House
Martell
she
is
styled
Princess
of
Dorne
In
the
current
generation
Prince
Doran
Martell
has
three
children
his
daughter
Arianne
followed
by
his
two
sonsQuentyn
and
Trystane
SinceArianne
is
the
oldest
child
she
is
ahead
of
her
two
younger
brothers
in
the
line
of
succession
and
has
indeed
been
actively
groomed
her
entire
life
to
one
day
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
Dorne
Any
children
Arianne
may
have
male
or
female
will
stand
in
line
of
succession
ahead
of
her
younger
brothers
and
their
children
Hypothetically
if
equal
primogeniture
were
applied
to
House
Stark
it
would
simply
follow
birth
order
Robb
Sansa
Arya
Bran
Rickon
Royal

About
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
disastrous
civil
war
occurred
within
House
Targaryen
when
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
was
challenged
for
the
succession
by
her
younger
halfbrother
Aegon
II
Targaryen
Although
Rhaenyra
had
been
officially
designated
as
the
heir
by
their
father
Aegon
II
insisted
that
a
younger
brother
always
inherited
ahead
of
an
older
sister
Afterwards
to
ensure
that
another
civil
war
would
not
occur
for
similar
reasons
the
Targaryens
adopted
a
highly
modified
form
of
malepreference
primogeniture
which
puts
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
heirs
Under
this
variant
a
kings
daughter
is
put
behind
the
kings
younger
brother
in
the
line
of
succession
This
is
the
least
common
succession
law
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
only
followed
by
the
royal
family
that
sits
on
the
Iron
Throne
however
by
the
same
virtue
it
is
disproportionately
important
because
it
determines
who
will
be
monarch
of
the
entire
realm
When
Robert
Baratheon
overthrew
House
Targaryen
in
his
rebellion
he
paid
token
lipservice
to
the
line
of
succession
by
claiming
the
throne
on
the
basis
of
a
distant
family
relationship
with
the
Targaryens
being
a
second
cousin
of
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
Thus
the
new
Baratheon
dynasty
founded
by
King
Robert
continued
to
function
under
the
modified
variant
of
royal
primogeniture
In
The
Wolf
and
the
Lion
Renly
Baratheon
and
Loras
Tyrell
have
a
conversation
in
which
they
explicitly
state
that
the
royal
line
of
succession
after
Robert
is
Joffrey
Tommen
Stannis
Renly
Note
that
this
skips
over
middlechild
Myrcella
passing
immediately
from
her
brother
Tommen
to
her
uncle
Stannis
For
that
matter
it
also
skips
over
Stannissdaughter
Shireen
who
would
have
been
ahead
of
Renly
under
normal
inheritance
law
Further
in
Cripples
Bastards
and
Broken
Things
Sansa
Stark
and
Septa
Mordane
state
that
if
Sansa
only
has
female
children
with
Joffrey
Joffreys
younger
brother
Tommen
would
be
ahead
of
them
in
the
line
of
succession
This
matches
the
modified
royal
variant
of
primogeniture
from
under
the
Targaryens
as
under
normal
primogeniture
laws
with
a
common
lord
a
lords
daughters
would
inherit
ahead
of
his
younger
brother
At
the
time
of
Roberts
Rebellion
the
line
of
succession
to
King
Aerys
II
was
his
son
Crown
Prince
Rhaegar
then
Rhaegars
infant
second
child
his
son
Aegon
who
had
he
lived
and
ascended
the
throne
would
have
ruled
as
Aegon
VI
Aegon
would
have
been
followed
by
Rhaegars
younger
brother
Viserys
Only
then
would
the
possible
female
heirs
of
House
Targaryen
been
considered
starting
with
Rhaegars
daughter
and
eldest
child
Rhaenys
Daenerys
was
actually
only
born
after
Rhaegar
Aegon
and
Rhaenys
had
all
died
but
had
none
of
them
been
killed
Daenerys
would
have
been
behind
Rhaenys
in
line
of
succession
Theoretically
the
exiled
survivors
of
House
Targaryen
continued
to
follow
modified
royal
primogeniture
However
the
principle
was
purely
academic
as
the
only
known
survivors
were
Viserys
Targaryen
and
his
younger
sister
Daenerys
and
Viserys
would
have
been
ahead
of
Daenerys
in
line
of
succession
even
under
normal
primogeniture
their
greatuncle
Aemon
was
forgotten
by
most
but
had
already
refused
the
throne
and
taken
himself
out
of
succession
by
joining
both
the
Maesters
and
the
Nights
Watch
After
Viserysdeath
Daenerys
became
the
last
Targaryen
making
the
principle
even
less
significant
If
Viserys
had
not
been
killed
and
if
Daenerysstilborn
son
Rhaego
survived
as
well
Rhaego
would
have
become
Viserysimmediate
heir
ahead
of
Daenerys
in
line
of
succession
Taken
to
its
utmost
extreme
of
putting
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
heirs
Stannis
may
officially
be
ahead
of
Daenerys
in
line
of
succession
Viserys
was
always
ahead
of
his
distant
cousin
Robert
but
Robert
was
still
Viseryss
closest
male
heir
and
with
Roberts
death
not
long
afterwards
coupled
with
Renlys
death
without
issue
this
makes
Stannis
the
closest
male
heir
However
because
Stannis
has
no
sons
only
his
daughter
Shireen
Daenerys
is
still
ahead
of
Shireen
in
line
of
succession
and
without
a
male
heir
Daenerysclaim
might
still
be
seen
as
ahead
of
the
Baratheon
line
Either
way
King
Aerys
sentenced
the
Baratheons
to
death
in
absentia
as
traitors
during
Roberts
Rebellion
so
Daenerys
could
probably
just
dismiss
Stannis
as
a
traitor
to
the
throne
along
with
his
brother
In
the
books
The
feudal
practices
in
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
actually
do
not
accurately
reflect
many
reallife
medieval
practices
The
greatest
deviation
presented
in
the
society
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
the
extreme
level
of
uniformity
in
feudal
practices
on
the
scale
of
an
entire
continent
Since
the
s
medieval
historians
have
strongly
challenged
that
feudalism
was
one
uniform
set
of
practices
in
all
countries
of
Europe
For
that
matter
feudal
laws
and
customs
differed
dramatically
even
within
feudal
countries
from
one
major
county
or
duchy
to
the
next
Current
scholarship
has
concluded
that
socalled
feudalism
as
a
universal
construct
never
actually
existed
The
very
use
of
the
term
feudalism
is
considered
to
be
outdated
On
the
other
hand
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
unified
under
the
Targaryen
kings
three
hundred
years
ago
and
this
may
explain
the
uniformity
in
feudal
practices
across
the
continent
In
later
books
George
RR
Martin
began
incorporating
new
background
information
to
try
to
convey
that
each
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
didnt
always
possess
uniform
societies
For
example
coinage
across
the
Seven
Kingdoms
during
the
time
of
Ned
Stark
is
quite
uniform
without
regional
variation
However
by
the
fourth
book
A
Feast
For
Crows
Martin
established
that
before
the
Targaryen
Conquest
the
Kingdom
of
the
Reach
minted
its
own
local
coinage
called
Hands
which
were
not
equivalent
to
coinage
from
other
kingdoms
The
World
of
Ice
and
Fire
sourcebook
does
point
out
that
even
Aegon
the
Conqueror
did
not
attempt
to
impose
a
uniform
system
of
laws
on
the
Seven
Kingdoms
after
he
unified
them
politically
but
let
each
continue
to
function
under
its
previous
local
laws
It
was
only
his
grandson
Jaehaerys
I
Targaryen
whose
long
and
peaceful
reign
lasted
for
years
who
was
ultimately
able
to
enforce
a
standardized
legal
code
across
all
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
even
then
a
process
which
took
many
years
and
which
of
course
even
he
was
largely
able
to
enforce
because
the
Targaryens
still
had
dragons
to
intimidate
the
local
rulers
into
acceptance
Dorne
wasnt
part
of
the
realm
at
the
time
and
because
the
union
was
through
marriagealliance
when
they
later
did
unite
with
the
Iron
Throne
a
century
later
still
about
one
century
ago
because
the
union
was
on
equal
terms
the
Dornish
were
allowed
to
keep
their
local
laws
and
customs
Another
major
difference
is
that
primogeniture
really
wasnt
practiced
throughout
much
of
Europe
for
most
of
the
Middle
Ages
The
famous
postWord
War
II
historian
Georges
Duby
put
forward
a
very
influential
social
model
of
the
Middle
Ages
claiming
that
primogeniture
was
practiced
throughout
Western
Europe
but
the
past
thirty
to
forty
years
worth
of
medieval
historians
have
largely
debunked
Dubys
theories
In
the
case
of
the
switchover
to
a
modified
royal
inheritance
system
of
male
primogeniture
in
which
female
heirs
are
placed
behind
all
possible
male
ones
actually
mirrors
the
reallife
introduction
of
the
Pauline
laws
in
Russia
by
Tsar
Paul
I

Summary
In
Kings
Landing
Underneath
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
Septa
Unella
enters
Queen
Margaery
Tyrells
cell
and
leads
her
to
a
private
meeting
with
the
High
Sparrow
The
High
Sparrow
asks
Margaery
what
she
would
do
if
he
allowed
her
to
leave
that
day
Margaery
replies
that
she
wants
to
return
to
her
family
and
her
husband
Tommen
Baratheon
The
High
Sparrow
respects
her
love
for
her
family
but
tells
her
that
attachment
leads
to
sin
citing
his
experience
as
a
cobbler
Margaery
manages
to
impress
the
Sparrow
with
her
knowledge
of
The
Book
of
the
Stranger
which
she
admits
Septa
Unella
had
read
at
her
The
High
Sparrow
chuckles
and
agrees
that
Unella
has
a
habit
of
reading
at
people
instead
of
to
them
The
High
Sparrow
recounts
how
in
his
youth
he
was
a
womanizer
and
drunkard
He
underwent
a
conversion
experience
the
morning
after
an
orgy
as
his
drunken
guests
lay
naked
all
around
his
house
Tired
of
what
he
was
now
perceiving
as
a
meaningless
existence
the
High
Sparrow
turned
his
life
around
and
became
a
devoted
member
of
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
He
then
left
his
job
as
a
cobbler
and
devoted
his
life
to
the
poor
and
destitute
Believing
he
has
found
a
way
to
reach
Margaery
the
Sparrow
allows
her
to
visit
her
brother
Loras
Tyrell
Margaery
remaining
in
her
cell
She
finds
a
dejected
Loras
lying
on
the
floor
of
his
cell
Loras
has
lost
the
will
to
continue
resisting
but
Margaery
tells
him
to
stay
strong
because
he
is
the
future
of
House
Tyrell
Loras
tells
them
that
he
only
wants
his
imprisonment
to
end
and
pleads
with
her
to
help
him
Margaery
tells
Loras
that
the
Sparrow
is
trying
to
use
them
to
break
each
other
and
again
tells
him
to
stay
strong
At
the
Red
Keep
Cersei
Lannister
walks
in
on
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
advising
King
Tommen
to
accommodate
the
High
Sparrow
and
the
Faith
Militant
Cersei
requests
that
Pycelle
leave
the
room
while
she
talks
to
her
son
alone
under
the
pretext
of
meeting
him
for
updates
about
the
previous
Small
Council
meetings
During
their
conversation
Tommen
proposes
that
the
Iron
Throne
not
antagonize
the
Sparrows
further
in
an
effort
to
avoid
endangering
Margaerys
life
Cersei
reminds
her
son
about
the
humiliation
she
endured
at
the
Sparrows
hands
and
exploits
Tommens
love
for
Margaery
She
convinces
her
son
that
the
High
Sparrow
has
no
respect
for
kings
queens
and
society
Tommen
then
reveals
a
secret
that
the
High
Sparrow
shared
with
him
Armed
with
this
new
information
Cersei
barges
into
a
Small
Council
meeting
between
Kevan
Lannister
Olenna
Tyrell
and
Jaime
Lannister
While
Kevan
and
Olenna
are
initially
hostile
Cersei
convinces
them
to
listen
to
her
She
then
informs
the
Council
that
the
High
Sparrow
has
planned
to
make
Margaery
do
the
walk
of
atonement
Olenna
is
horrified
that
the
Sparrows
plan
to
debase
her
granddaughter
Jaime
then
urges
the
Council
to
allow
the
Tyrells
to
march
their
army
into
Kings
Landing
crush
the
Faith
Militant
and
bring
Margaery
and
Loras
back
to
the
Red
Keep
into
Crown
custody
Kevan
says
that
Tommen
expressly
forbid
him
to
use
the
Lannister
army
he
commands
at
the
city
to
make
a
move
against
the
Great
Sept
for
fear
that
the
Faith
Militant
will
harm
Margaery
in
retaliation
Jaime
suggests
that
Olenna
send
House
Tyrells
army
to
the
city
instead
and
points
out
to
his
uncle
that
Tommen
only
forbade
his
army
from
making
a
move
but
he
never
expressly
told
him
to
prevent
anyone
else
from
trying
so
Kevan
wouldnt
be
breaking
any
commands
if
his
forces
simply
stand
down
when
the
Tyrell
army
arrives
The
Tyrell
army
will
surround
the
Great
Sept
intimidating
the
Sparrows
into
releasing
Margaery
and
Loras
without
any
blood
actually
being
shed
and
by
the
time
Tommen
finds
out
what
theyve
done
he
will
already
be
happy
with
the
outcome
Kevans
interest
is
now
turned
but
he
still
expresses
reluctance
should
they
fail
Cersei
is
able
to
make
him
change
his
mind
by
exploiting
his
hatred
towards
the
Sparrows
for
taking
his
last
remaining
son
and
heir
Lancel
Lannister
Olenna
agrees
that
blood
will
be
shed
no
matter
what
they
do
at
this
point
so
its
better
if
its
the
Sparrows
blood
and
not
theirs

Some
time
later

and
that

will
unite
behind

North
Jon
resolves

Petyr
Baelish
arrives
with
a
retinue
of
Arryn
guards
and
a
pet
falcon
as
a
belated

gift
Royce
reminds
Baelish
that
Baelish
told
him
that
he
was
taking

cousin
Sansa
with
him
to
The
Fingers
but
Royce
received
word
that
she
had
been
married
to

Baelish
tells
him
that
on
the
way
to
The
Fingers
he
and
Sansa
were
set
upon
by
a
large
force
of
Bolton
men
A
confrontation
between

ensues
in
which
Petyr
accuses
Royce
of
giving
away
the
information
regarding
the
location
of
Sansa

to
House
Bolton
When
Royce
accuses
Baelish
of
slander
Petyr
reminds
him
that
Robin
is
the
Lord
of
the
Vale
and
asks
for
his
judgment
Robin
then
asks
Baelish
if
they
should
throw
Lord
Royce
from

Door
which
prompts
the
surrounding
knights
including
those
loyal
to
Royce
to
muster
themselves
Royce
swears
his
loyalty
to
Robin
and
he
is
let
off
without
punishment
on
Baelishs
recommendation
Royce
comes
onto
the
dark
realization
that
Littlefinger
has
control
over
Robin
Petyr
and
Robin
decide
they
have
to
muster
the
Vale
knights
to
march
North
and
aid
Sansa
In
Winterfell
At
Winterfell
Osha
is
brought
before
Ramsay
Bolton
who
says
that
while
her
fellow
captive
Rickon
Stark
has
value
to
Ramsay
he
is
unsure
of
her
worth
Osha
denounces
the
Starks
saying
that
her
servitude
and
loyalty
to
them
were
forced
She
also
attempts
to
seduce
Ramsay
climbing
onto
his
lap
and
kissing
him
all
the
while
trying
to
get
the
knife
he
had
been
using
to
peel
apples
Ramsay
seemingly
falls
for
it
saying
that
it
took
much
longer
for
him
to
get
Theon
Greyjoy
over
to
his
side
but
that
Theon
told
him
everything
including
how
Osha
had
seduced
Theon
in
order
to
help
Rickon
and
Bran
Stark
escape
Winterfell
Osha
realizes
that
she
has
been
lured
into
a
trap
and
tries
to
stab
Ramsay
only
for
him
to
slash
her
throat
She
dies
shortly
thereafter
At
Pyke
Theon
returns
home
Theon
Greyjoy
returns
home
to
Pyke
where
he
learns
of
the
death
of
his
father
Balon
Greyjoy
His
sister
Yara
is
unhappy
about
his
return
and
his
earlier
refusal
to
leave
the
Dreadfort
when
she
made
an
attempt
to
rescue
Theon
from
Ramsay
Bolton
Theon
explains
that
Ramsay
broke
him
into
a
thousand
pieces
which
Yara
affirms
Yes
he
sent
us
one
of
those
pieces
referring
to
the
box
containing
Theons
penis
that
she
and
Balon
Greyjoy
received
Yara
suspects
that
Theon
has
come
back
to
declare
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
but
he
insists
that
he
does
not
want
the
crown
Instead
Theon
explains
he
wants
for
Yara
to
rule
with
him
helping
her
in
any
way
that
he
can
In
Meereen
Tyrion
Lannister
along
with
Grey
Worm
Missandei
and
Varys
meet
with
representatives
of
the
Good
Masters
of
Astapor
the
Wise
Masters
of
Yunkai
and
the
slavetrading
city
of
Volantis
who
have
arrived
by
sea
As
the
diplomatic
mission
enters
the
harbor
Grey
Worm
advocates
using
military
force
When
Tyrion
explains
that
he
is
able
to
empathize
with
slaves
because
he
spent
one
day
as
a
slave
Missandei
counters
that
he
has
not
truly
experienced
slavery
The
emissaries
are
Tyrions
former
slave
master
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
the
Yunkaii
Wise
Master
Razdal
mo
Eraz
and
the
Volantene
triarch
Belicho
Paenymion
Varys
Tyrion
and
Missandei
converge
to
prepare
for
their
meeting
In
their
meeting
chambers
Yezzan
marvels
at
how
Tyrion
went
from
being
a
nearlyworthless
slave
to
the
de
facto
ruler
of
Meereen
The
slavetrading
cities
offer
to
give
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
her
mercenaries
a
large
pot
of
money
if
they
sail
away
from
Slavers
Bay
When
Missandei
defends
Daeneryss
actions
in
liberating
slaves
Razdal
contends
that
slavery
has
existed
for
centuries
After
hearing
their
offer
Tyrion
proposes
a
counteroffer
He
offers
to
give
them
a
sevenyear
grace
period
to
phase
out
slavery
and
to
compensate
slave
owners
however
they
must
end
all
backing
for
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
regardless
of
whether
they
admit
this
backing
or
not
He
then
cautionsthem
that
they
will
not
get
a
better
offer
Tyrion
then
gives
them
time
to
consider
his
offer
though
Grey
Worm
and
Missandei
insist
on
abolishing
slavery
Tyrion
and
his
entourage
are
later
confronted
by
a
crowd
of
former
slaves
in
the
Meereen
throne
room
A
freedman
demands
to
know
when
Daenerys
will
return
while
another
is
appalled
at
the
idea
of
Tyrion
negotiating
with
slave
traders
Tyrion
insists
he
is
doing
his
best
to
rule
the
city
in
Daeneryss
absence
The
freedmen
do
not
trust
Tyrion
a
foreigner
and
a
newcomer
and
look
to
Grey
Worm
and
Missandei
for
reassurance
Despite
their
misgivings
they
both
publicly
back
Tyrions
diplomacy
in
front
of
the
freedmen
In
private
Grey
Worm
and
Missandei
warn
Tyrion
that
the
masters
will
outmaneuver
him
despite
his
best
efforts
to
do
the
same
to
them
In
Vaes
Dothrak
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
and
Daario
Naharis
approach
the
outskirts
of
Vaes
Dothrak
and
discard
their
weapons
as
drawing
a
blade
in
the
city
is
considered
sacrilege
Within
the
city
itself
Jorah
and
Daario
run
afoul
of
Akho
and
Iggo
who
see
through
Jorahs
claims
to
be
a
wine
merchant
Daario
takes
care
of
Iggo
while
Akho
tackles
Jorah
The
knight
is
nearly
undone
but
Daario
saves
him
at
the
last
minute
with
the
stiletto
he
smuggled
in
At
Jorahs
insistence
Daario
smashes
Aggos
skull
with
a
rock
so
that
no
one
will
think
he
was
killed
with
a
bladed
weapon
Meanwhile
the
High
Priestess
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
gives
Daenerys
a
commentary
on
the
other
crones
Some
of
them
hate
Daenerys
thinking
the
Dothraki
should
not
interbreed
with
other
races
but
the
high
priestess
dismisses
them
saying
that
the
Dothraki
have
always
interbred
and
have
never
been
concerned
with
blood
purity
To
illustrate
her
point
the
high
priestess
indicates
another
of
the
khaleen
a
Lhazareen
girl
Ornela
taken
from
her
village
at
the
age
of
twelve
Daenerys
asks
to
relieve
herself
and
the
high
priestess
sends
Ornela
with
her
As
they
walk
Daenerys
learns
that
Ornelas
khal
died
when
she
was
only
sixteen
The
pair
are
interrupted
by
Jorah
and
Daario
who
take
the
Lhazareen
hostage
Daenerys
unsurprised
to
see
them
cancels
their
plans
for
escape
they
have
a
slim
chance
of
leaving
Vaes
Dothrak
let
alone
getting
back
to
Meereen
and
tells
them
that
she
has
a
plan
of
her
own
She
asks
Ornela
if
she
is
willing
to
help
them
calling
her
a
Khaleesi
queen
instead
of
a
khaleen
crone
The
girl
reluctantly
agrees
During
the
Khalar
vezhven
the
khals
argue
about
how
to
deal
with
Iggo
and
Akhos
deaths
Khal
Moro
defuses
the
situation
by
reminding
them
that
Ahko
was
a
member
of
his
khalasar
and
he
does
not
care
about
finding
the
killer
if
he
was
stupid
enough
to
get
himself
killed
Daenerys
is
then
brought
in
by
the
two
priestesses
she
befriended
before
Moro
insists
that
she
join
the
dosh
khaleen
but
another
khal
expresses
interest
in
making
her
his
khaleesi
while
another
suggests
giving
her
to
the
Wise
Masters
in
exchange
for
ten
thousand
horses
Daenerys
dismisses
all
of
them
she
claims
that
they
are
all
petty
and
weak
and
reminds
them
that
Khal
Drogo
was
willing
to
cross
the
poison
water
in
wooden
horses
for
his
conquests
Stating
that
none
of
the
khals
are
fit
to
lead
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
declares
that
she
will
lead
them
herself
After
a
pause
Moro
and
the
khals
burst
into
laughter
Dany
reminds
them
that
her
husband
in
the
same
temple
in
which
they
all
now
sit
declared
that
he
would
lead
a
Dothraki
army
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
retake
the
Iron
Throne
for
his
khaleesi
However
since
this
time
Daenerys
tells
them
that
all
the
khals
have
done
now
is
to
raid
and
plunder
villages
in
lieu
of
any
meaningful
conquest
Disgusted
with
her
insolence
Moro
declares
that
she
will
be
raped
by
each
of
the
khals
then
by
all
of
their
bloodriders
and
then
if
she
is
still
alive
by
their
horses
He
mocks
her
once
more
declaring
disbelief
at
the
notion
of
them
serving
her
Dany
proves
to
the
Dothraki
who
their
true
Khaleesi
is
Daenerys
is
unfazed
by
the
threats
and
remains
smiling
She
calmly
reaches
over
and
clamps
her
hand
on
a
burning
brazier
which
doesnt
affect
her
at
all
to
the
shock
and
slight
fear
of
the
khals
Still
holding
it
Daenerys
tells
the
khals
that
they
arent
going
to
serve
theyre
going
to
die
With
these
words
she
topples
the
brazier
and
it
sets
the
floor
of
the
hut
alight
in
seconds
The
khals
desperately
attempt
to
escape
the
rapidlyspreading
fire
only
to
find
the
temples
only
door
barred
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
guarding
it
lying
dead
outside
Khal
Moro
is
the
only
one
left
as
he
turns
to
face
Daenerys
who
pushes
the
last
brazier
over
Khal
Moro
is
engulfed
by
flames
and
his
screams
dont
last
long
Jorah
and
Daario
bow
down
to
their
queen
As
the
flames
climb
higher
the
dosh
khaleen
and
khalasars
gather
in
confusion
watching
their
temple
burn
Eventually
the
doors
collapse
and
Daenerys
emerges
her
clothes
burnt
off
her
back
but
otherwise
untouched
by
the
flames
The
entire
leadership
present
at
Vaes
Dothrak
is
now
dead
Awed
horrified
and
fearful
in
equal
measure
the
crowd
of
thousands
bow
to
Daenerys
almost
immediately
with
the
high
priestess
and
the
rest
of
the
dosh
khaleen
following
after
a
moment
Jorah
and
Daario
move
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
and
bow
last

The
Eyrie
returns
to
the
Title
sequence
last
seen
at
the
beginning
of
Season
As
with
that
episode
the
events
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn
do
not
actually
take
place
in
the
Eyrie
but
at
Runestone
the
seat
of
House
Royce
but
the
production
team
explained
they
can
only
justify
the
expense
of
creating
so
many
individually
animated
map
markers
and
they
often
use
a
regions
capital
as
a
standin
for
the
whole
area
Pyke
doesnt
appear
in
the
opening
sequence
despite
being
a
place
of
action
in
this
episode
and
being
present
in
the
previous
episode
where
the
location
wasnt
featured
The
Stranger
is
the
aspect
of
The
Seven
that
represents
death
The
holy
text
of
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
The
SevenPointed
Star
which
is
divided
up
into
internal
books
like
the
reallife
Christian
Bible
etc
ie
one
internal
division
is
the
Book
of
the
Maiden
devoted
to
The
Maiden
another
aspect
of
the
Seven
The
episode
takes
its
name
from
when
Margaery
points
out
that
the
High
Septon
is
quoting
a
verse
from
the
Book
of
the
Stranger
Only
the
Book
of
the
Maiden
has
been
mentioned
by
name
in
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
so
far
but
it
is
presumed
each
aspect
of
the
godhead
has
its
own
book
As
David
Benioff
directly
points
out
in
the
Inside
the
Episode
featurette
Jon
Snow
and
Sansa
Stark
have
never
shared
dialogue
onscreen
before
this
episode
in
the
entire
TV
series
despite
growing
up
in
the
same
family
as
siblings
In
the
series
premiere
Winter
is
Coming
when
the
Stark
family
gathers
to
welcome
King
Robert
Jon
appears
in
the
scene
but
is
seen
standing
behind
Ned
and
Robb
and
is
placed
beside
Theon
Greyjoy
as
they
shared
a
similar
social
position
as
an
illegitimate
son
and
a
ward
respectively
Additionally
as
Cersei
Lannister
remarks
in
the
fourth
novel
she
noticed
the
Starks
doing
their
best
to
hide
Jon
during
her
visit
with
King
Robert
Baratheon
to
Winterfell
which
could
be
an
effort
by
Ned
to
protect
Jon
by
hiding
him
from
Robert
and
the
Lannisters
In
the
novels
Jon
and
Sansa
didnt
have
any
onpage
scenes
together
at
Winterfell
in
the
first
novel
Jon
was
always
closer
to
Arya
who
was
also
a
social
outsider
of
a
sort
Sansa
speaks
to
Jon
about
the
day
we
left
Winterfell
Sansa
and
Jon
did
leave
the
castle
on
the
same
day
in
episode
The
Kingsroad
Jon
took
the
opportunity
to
ask
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
so
he
rode
along
with
their
father
Sansa
their
sister
Arya
and
the
royal
party
to
the
crossroads
where
he
and
their
uncle
Benjenturned
north
and
Sansa
with
the
royal
party
turned
south
Though
Sansa
and
Jon
dont
have
a
particularly
close
relationship
in
the
books
they
think
of
each
other
several
times
throughout
the
series
after
their
familys
separation
Some
examples
include
Jon
recalling
how
Sansa
had
taught
him
how
to
talk
to
girls
and
while
regarding
the
beauty
of
a
winter
morning
fondly
thinks
that
Sansa
would
call
it
an
enchantment
In
the
fourth
book
Sansa
learns
of
Jons
new
position
as
Lord
Commander
of
the
Nights
Watch
while
she
is
still
hiding
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn
with
Littlefinger
when
someone
mentions
to
her
that
Eddard
Starks
bastard
son
was
recently
elected
as
Lord
Commander
She
then
realizes
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
see
Jon
again
In
the
TV
show
Sansa
is
told
about
Jons
election
in
Season
but
by
Ramsay
Bolton
under
different
circumstances
Sansa
and
Jon
have
not
reunited
as
of
the
end
of
the
most
recent
novel
Jons
storyline
in
the
TV
series
surpassed
the
novels
when
he
was
stabbed
to
death
while
Sansas
has
loosely
surpassed
the
novels
but
also
been
heavily
condensed
in
the
novels
she
stays
in
the
Vale
and
never
even
meets
the
Boltons
It
is
entirely
possible
that
she
will
meet
Jon
again
in
an
upcoming
novel
and
their
reactions
will
be
very
much
similar
to
this
though
several
details
have
of
course
been
moved
around
Sansas
view
in
this
episode
that
she
was
an
ass
to
Jon
may
be
somewhat
of
an
exaggeration
in
comparison
to
her
behavior
toward
him
in
the
novels
While
Sansa
looked
up
to
and
shared
many
similarities
with
her
motherCatelyn
Starkwho
completely
ignored
Jon
but
didnt
mistreat
him
according
to
the
standards
of
Westeros
and
Sansa
and
Jon
have
the
most
distant
relationship
of
the
Stark
children
they
think
of
each
other
fondly
in
the
novels
following
their
family
being
separated
into
different
directions
Growing
up
Jon
and
Sansas
paths
did
not
cross
much
since
Sansa
was
very
aware
of
social
standings
enjoyed
feminine
persuits
was
tutored
by
Septa
Mordane
and
spent
time
with
her
mother
while
Jon
spent
most
of
his
time
with
their
father
brothers
being
tutored
by
Maester
Luwin
and
shared
interests
with
Robb
and
Arya
with
whom
he
was
very
close
As
a
result
while
Sansa
and
Jon
shared
each
others
company
during
family
activities
in
the
novels
such
as
Aryas
memory
of
Robb
and
Jon
playing
a
prank
on
their
younger
siblings
in
the
crypts
Jon
had
less
interaction
with
Sansa
than
he
did
with
Robb
Arya
and
Bran
While
Arya
mentally
notes
that
Sansa
was
always
careful
to
refer
to
Jon
as
their
halfbrother
and
a
bastard
as
a
legal
term
not
explicitly
pejorative
probably
under
the
influence
of
Catelyn
Sansa
did
not
mistreat
or
mock
Jon
In
the
second
novel
Jon
remembers
how
Sansa
took
time
aside
to
help
teach
him
how
to
properly
court
girls
when
he
asked
her
to
so
Sansas
relationship
with
Jon
was
evidently
better
than
Catelyns
relationship
with
him
was
This
episode
features
no
less
than
three
reunions
between
brothersister
pairs
Jon
Snow
and
Sansa
Stark
Theon
and
Yara
Greyjoy
and
Margaery
and
Loras
Tyrell
The
reunion
between
Sansa
and
Jon
is
the
first
time
any
of
the
separated
Stark
siblings
have
reunited
since
splitting
up
in
Season
except
for
Bran
and
Rickon
who
separated
at
the
end
of
Season
There
were
several
chances
of
reunion
Arya
arrived
at
the
Twins
right
after
the
Red
Wedding
started
Aryas
arrival
at
the
Vale
Jon
attacking
the
mutineers
while
Bran
was
nearby
Arya
trying
to
sail
North
to
Castle
Black
but
in
every
case
the
reunion
was
prevented
for
various
reason
to
the
point
where
the
Stark
children
almost
reuniting
but
just
barely
missing
each
other
has
become
a
running
joke
in
the
fandom
As
of
the
end
of
the
fifth
novel
both
Jon
and
Sansa
are
lead
to
believe
the
other
three
remaining
Stark
siblings
Arya
Bran
and
Rickon
are
probably
dead
In
the
TV
version
Brienne
actually
encountered
Arya
briefly
and
informed
Sansa
she
was
alive
two
episodes
ago
information
they
can
now
share
with
Jon
Theon
Greyjoy
informed
Sansa
that
Bran
and
Rickon
survived
the
sack
of
Winterfell
Meanwhile
Jon
actually
knows
that
Bran
and
Rickon
didnt
die
at
Winterfell
Bran
encountered
Samwell
Tarly
as
he
was
passing
through
the
Wall
as
he
did
in
the
novels
and
made
him
swear
not
to
tell
anyone
in
the
Season
finale
Unlike
in
the
novels
however
Sam
tells
Jon
anyway
as
seen
in
Season
Thus
if
Jon
and
Sansa
presumably
shared
information
offscreen
they
now
know
that
there
is
at
least
some
chance
that
all
three
of
the
other
Stark
siblings
who
were
believed
dead
might
still
be
alive
In
contrast
to
Jon
and
Sansa
Ramsay
Bolton
preferred
being
an
only
child
and
to
acheive
this
he
killed
his
parents
and
infant
halfbrother
and
is
now
the
last
living
member
of
House
Bolton
and
the
only
people
who
fight
for
him
are
those
he
can
intimidate
into
serving
him
The
encounter
between
Brienne
of
Tarth
Davos
Seaworth
and
Melisandre
in
Castle
Blacks
court
yard
addresses
several
logical
questions
about
how
they
would
react
to
each
other
in
rapid
succession
First
Davos
is
indeed
curious
about
what
exactly
happened
to
Stannis
Baratheon
and
Shireen
whom
Melisandre
burned
as
a
sacrifice
Second
Brienne
accurately
points
out
that
she
did
in
fact
meet
Davos
before
and
also
Melisandre
as
she
was
a
member
of
Renly
Baratheons
Kingsguard
they
met
during
the
formal
parley
between
Stannis
and
Renly
back
in
Season
episode
Garden
of
Bones
though
Brienne
didnt
say
anything
at
the
time
Third
upon
meeting
Davos
Brienne
bluntly
admits
that
she
executed
Stannis
in
the
Season
finale
and
that
just
prior
to
this
Stannis
outright
confessed
he
used
blood
magic
to
assassinate
Renly
which
she
says
while
glaring
at
Melisandre
who
killed
Renly
by
birthing
a
Shadow
monster
in
episode
The
Ghost
of
Harrenhal
Tormund
seems
quite
impressed
with
Brienne
of
Tarth
even
though
men
in
southern
Westeros
in
prior
episodes
often
thought
she
was
some
kind
of
freak
or
object
of
ridicule
for
being
a
larger
strong
female
warrior
Recall
that
the
wildlings
actually
have
a
strong
tradition
of
warrior
women
Ygritte
Karsi
etc
so
it
makes
sense
that
Tormund
would
actually
think
Brienne
is
impressive
andor
attractive
instead
of
being
dismissive
to
her
like
southern
knights
she
has
encountered
in
the
past
In
Season
it
was
said
that
Jon
Snow
and
Tormund
only
managed
to
save
about
wildlings
by
getting
them
to
the
southern
side
of
the
Wall
Tormund
confirms
now
that
only
about
are
in
fighting
shape
the
rest
are
children
old
people
etc
Other
than
Mance
Rayder
the
fate
of
the
substantial
number
of
fightingwildlings
captured
by
Stannis
following
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
has
not
been
specified
Sansa
says
Ramsay
remarked
that
the
Bolton
forces
at
Winterfell
are
around
men
It
is
unclear
but
this
might
refer
specifically
to
just
the
Bolton
forces
not
the
added
Karstark
and
Umber
forces
which
came
to
Winterfell
only
after
Sansa
escaped
at
the
end
of
Season
In
the
books
the
Boltons
had
about
men
at
Winterfell
itself
not
including
the
forces
from
the
other
Northern
Houses
currently
allied
with
the
Boltons
who
brought
about
another
men
which
seems
to
match
up
with
this
Theon
Greyjoys
homecoming
scene
to
Pyke
in
the
Iron
Islands
after
being
a
prisoner
of
the
Boltons
at
Winterfell
visually
mirrors
his
earlier
homecoming
to
Pyke
in
Season
after
years
being
a
prisoner
Ward
of
the
Starks
at
Winterfell
Just
as
in
episode
The
Night
Lands
Theon
is
first
shown
looking
at
Pyke
from
a
ship
then
when
he
enters
the
main
hall
encounters
a
family
member
upset
with
him
Yara
Greyjoy
is
framed
the
same
way
their
father
Balon
was
in
the
previous
episode
seated
in
a
chair
and
looking
into
the
fire
not
bothering
at
first
to
turn
around
and
face
Theon
while
talking
to
him
The
way
Jaime
Lannisters
dialogue
at
the
Small
Council
scene
is
framed
is
somewhat
confusing
House
Tyrell
actually
has
the
largest
army
in
Westeros
House
Lannister
the
second
largest
under
normal
circumstances
On
top
of
this
Robb
Stark
slaughtered
half
the
Lannister
army
while
the
Tyrell
forces
have
comparatively
been
only
lightly
bloodied
in
the
conflicts
and
Tywin
explained
in
Season
that
the
Lannisters
are
bankrupt
and
cant
simply
hire
new
sellsword
armies
anymore
In
this
episode
Jaime
walks
to
the
table
and
says
you
have
the
second
largest
army
in
Westeros
but
the
camera
is
in
wideshot
so
it
is
unclear
if
he
is
referring
to
his
uncle
Kevan
commander
of
the
remaining
Lannister
forces
which
should
now
be
the
second
largest
or
to
Olenna
Tyrell
He
then
goes
on
to
explain
that
the
Tyrell
army
will
come
to
besiege
the
Great
Sept
while
Kevans
army
already
in
the
city
simply
stands
down
and
doesnt
try
to
stop
them
which
in
contrast
to
his
last
sentence
would
seem
to
imply
that
he
was
actually
referring
to
Kevan
when
he
said
you
have
the
second
largest
army
In
the
novels
Cersei
was
kept
confined
to
chambers
and
her
uncle
Kevan
kept
her
under
constant
guard
and
wouldnt
let
her
see
visitors
unsupervised
In
previous
episodes
this
season
Cersei
wasnt
under
guard
and
it
was
vaguely
implied
she
was
free
to
move
around
the
city
but
chose
not
to
out
of
fear
for
her
safety
In
this
episode
it
is
clearly
stated
that
she
is
under
house
arrest
in
that
she
is
forbidden
to
leave
the
Red
Keep
itself
she
did
leave
to
see
Jaime
and
Myrcella
return
at
the
docks
but
presumably
she
would
have
received
permission
for
that
As
Robin
Arryn
mentions
he
is
Sansa
Starks
cousin
specifically
her
first
cousin
as
his
mother
Lysa
Tully
was
the
younger
sister
of
Sansas
mother
Catelyn
Tully
A
promo
image
of
Pycelle
advising
Tommen
in
this
episode
was
previously
released
for
the
Season
premiere
Either
the
scene
was
moved
to
this
episode
or
more
probably
given
the
context
the
promo
image
was
simply
mislabeled
The
High
Sparrow
hasnt
given
any
backstory
about
himself
in
the
current
novels
it
is
unclear
if
the
story
he
relates
about
himself
in
this
episode
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
or
will
be
revealed
in
a
future
novel
His
story
to
Margaery
however
seems
to
conflict
with
his
introduction
to
Cersei
in
episode
to
Cersei
he
says
that
he
gave
his
shoes
away
to
someone
who
needed
them
more
while
to
Margaery
he
says
he
left
his
shoes
behind
the
day
he
walked
away
from
finery
Its
unclear
which
story
if
any
is
true
In
Margaery
Tyrells
prison
cell
a
large
beetle
appears
similar
to
the
one
that
Tyrion
chose
not
to
smash
in
Season
s
The
Mountain
and
the
Viper
after
giving
a
speech
recalling
his
cousin
Orson
Lannister
This
is
obviously
not
the
same
beetle
given
that
Tyrion
was
imprisoned
in
the
dungeons
of
the
Red
Keep
while
Margaery
is
imprisoned
on
the
other
side
of
he
city
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
Tyrion
says
that
a
clever
man
once
said
that
you
make
peace
with
your
enemies
otherwise
youd
already
be
friends
It
was
actually
Littlefinger
himself
who
said
this
to
Eddard
Stark
back
in
Season
s
You
Win
or
You
Die
urging
he
should
make
peace
with
the
Lannisters
instead
of
openly
revealing
that
Joffrey
was
a
bastard
Littlefinger
never
said
this
to
Tyrion
onscreen
but
could
easily
have
used
the
same
line
again
at
an
offscreen
Small
Council
meeting
Tyrion
attended
in
early
Season
This
episode
once
again
brings
up
a
discrepancy
with
the
currency
used
in
Slavers
Bay
the
Gold
Honor
coin
In
Season
s
The
Gift
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
indeed
bought
Tyrion
at
a
slaveauction
for
Gold
Honor
as
he
recounts
in
this
episode
For
Jorah
Mormont
a
welltrained
knight
being
sold
as
a
gladiator
the
bidding
started
at
Gold
Honors
and
he
was
bought
by
Yezzan
for
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
a
bid
of
Gold
Honors
at
auction
for
a
pair
of
slaves
sent
to
the
fighting
pits
is
actually
thought
to
be
an
insultingly
low
offer
In
the
subsequent
Season
Bluray
set
the
Histories
Lore
animated
featurette
on
The
Fighting
Pits
of
Meereen
contradicted
this
by
stating
that
a
champion
gladiator
slave
can
be
worth
Gold
Honors
a
figure
much
more
closely
in
line
with
the
relative
value
of
the
Gold
Honor
given
in
the
books
Benioff
and
Weiss
wrote
both
The
Gift
and
this
episode
while
Dave
Hill
writes
the
Histories
and
Lore
featurettes
Hill
understands
the
relative
value
of
the
Gold
Honor
given
in
the
novels
but
apparently
never
corrected
Benioff
and
Weiss
about
this
The
episode
accurately
displays
that
the
Dothraki
dont
believe
in
money
and
dont
use
any
form
of
currency
They
will
take
precious
objects
as
plunder
if
they
come
upon
it
but
otherwise
prefer
barter
and
tribute
of
inherently
useful
things
such
as
new
steel
weapons
and
armor
or
horses
Thus
it
is
mentioned
that
Yunkai
offered
the
Dothraki
Horses
in
exchange
for
Daenerys
as
opposed
to
a
large
amount
of
Gold
Honors
Tyrion
Lannister
says
that
slavery
has
not
existed
in
Westeros
for
centuries
this
is
specifically
true
though
in
fact
it
actually
hasnt
existed
in
Westeros
for
much
longer
at
least
thousands
of
years
The
Andals
invaded
Westeros
years
ago
but
their
religion
forbade
slavery
and
the
First
Men
who
moved
to
Westeros
before
them
years
ago
didnt
believe
in
slavery
either
As
far
as
historians
can
tell
slavery
has
never
been
practiced
in
Westeros
The
ironborn
do
skirt
this
a
bit
by
keeping
thralls
but
thralls
cannot
be
bought
or
sold
and
their
children
are
born
free
thralls
are
more
like
prisoners
of
war
even
the
ironborn
explicitly
believe
fullfledged
slavery
is
abhorrent
Razdal
mo
Eraz
returns
in
this
episode
the
political
envoy
from
Yunkai
who
was
introduced
back
in
Season
episode
The
Bear
and
the
Maiden
Fair
He
also
summarizes
his
encounter
with
her
from
that
episode
he
outright
offered
her
a
fleet
of
ships
to
transport
her
army
to
Westeros
and
just
leave
Yunkais
slavemasters
to
their
own
devices
which
he
felt
was
a
generous
and
mutually
beneficial
offer
but
she
refused
and
insisted
on
staying
to
topple
the
slavemasters
His
return
now
is
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
due
to
economy
of
characters
after
meeting
with
Daenerys
in
the
third
novel
much
as
he
did
in
Season
he
later
returned
in
the
fifth
novel
in
which
he
was
one
of
the
lead
politicians
arranging
the
YunkaiAstaporVolantis
slaveralliance
now
opposing
Daeneryss
rule
over
Meereen
In
the
novels
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
was
actually
one
of
the
Wise
Masters
of
Yunkai
though
the
character
was
significantly
changed
as
in
the
books
he
is
morbidly
obese
and
one
of
the
more
powerful
slavemasters
In
Season
he
bought
Jorah
and
Tyrion
at
a
slaveauction
on
the
outskirts
of
Meereen
seeming
to
imply
that
in
the
TV
show
he
is
one
of
the
Great
Masters
of
Meereen
not
of
Yunkai
On
the
other
hand
this
never
ruled
out
the
possibility
that
he
was
a
Yunkish
slavemaster
visiting
Meereen
for
the
gladiator
games
as
it
was
stated
the
Yunkish
slavemasters
themselves
wanted
the
games
to
open
because
they
brought
in
a
lot
of
money
for
the
entire
region
Now
in
this
episode
it
is
stated
that
Yezzan
is
representing
the
reconstituted
Good
Masters
of
Astapor
Exactly
which
of
the
three
major
cities
of
Slavers
Bay
TVYezzan
is
supposed
to
be
from
is
therefore
unclear
Then
again
he
doesnt
necessarily
need
to
be
from
one
of
them
as
there
are
slavemasters
and
merchants
that
move
around
between
the
slavemarkets
of
all
three
cities
to
conduct
trade
The
large
ship
which
the
three
ambassadors
from
the
slaveralliance
arrive
at
Meereen
in
displays
on
its
sails
the
symbol
of
a
Harpy
clasping
chainsandmanacles
in
its
talons
which
is
specifically
the
symbol
of
Astapor
This
specific
design
was
previously
used
onscreen
at
Astapor
in
Season
In
the
novels
the
different
cities
actually
use
slightly
different
variants
of
the
harpy
symbol
The
symbol
of
the
old
Ghiscari
Empire
which
originally
founded
all
three
cities
as
colonies
was
of
a
harpy
grasping
thunderbolts
in
its
talons
As
for
the
empires
presentday
descendants
Astapor
uses
a
harpy
with
chains
and
open
manacles
in
its
talons
Yunkais
harpy
holds
a
whip
and
open
slave
collar
while
Meereens
harpy
holds
nothing
Only
the
Astapori
harpy
has
explicitly
appeared
on
banners
or
sails
so
far
in
the
TV
series
it
is
unclear
if
it
is
meant
to
be
the
only
symbol
of
the
slavemasters
in
the
TV
continuity
with
no
variation
between
the
three
cities
or
if
this
ship
simply
happens
to
be
from
Astapor
Given
that
Yezzan
outright
states
that
he
is
there
as
a
representative
of
the
reconstituted
slavemasters
of
Astapor
it
is
entirely
plausible
that
it
is
simply
an
Astapori
ship
Razdal
represents
Yunkai
and
Yezzan
says
he
represents
Astapor
but
the
identity
of
the
third
slaver
ambassador
who
does
have
speaking
lines
is
not
directly
stated
By
simply
process
of
elimination
he
must
be
from
Volantis
given
that
last
episode
Varys
discovered
that
the
foreign
cities
funding
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
are
Yunkai
Astapor
and
Volantis
On
closer
inspection
however
there
is
another
hint
this
ambassadors
costume
style
matches
what
was
seen
in
Volantis
when
it
first
appeared
back
in
Season
see
Costumes
Essos
Free
Cities
The
name
given
for
the
third
envoy
in
promotional
images
was
Belicho
Paenymion
which
is
itself
a
combination
of
different
Volantene
names
from
the
books
Ironically
Volantis
doesnt
actually
have
its
own
unique
costume
style
outofuniverse
During
production
on
Season
the
few
scenes
taking
place
in
Volantis
were
only
in
one
episode
and
squeezed
in
very
much
at
the
last
minute
after
the
budget
and
time
for
making
entirely
new
sets
and
costumes
had
completely
been
spent
on
other
new
locations
which
appear
much
more
prominently
such
as
Braavos
Necessity
being
the
mother
of
invention
however
the
production
team
was
still
determined
to
make
functional
sets
and
costumes
for
the
brief
scenes
set
in
Volantis
by
quickly
repurposing
and
modifying
preexisting
sets
and
costumes
in
the
industry
this
is
sometimes
known
as
kitbashing
In
the
Season
Bluray
commentary
costume
designer
Michele
Clapton
explains
the
process
and
that
ultimately
she
was
very
proud
of
how
it
turned
out
and
how
much
work
her
team
put
in
with
limited
resources
The
cast
and
crew
also
had
fun
trying
to
guess
which
bits
and
pieces
of
the
Volantis
set
dressing
were
from
what
other
parts
of
the
TV
show
For
specifically
the
costumes
of
Volantis
many
of
them
were
actually
costumes
previously
used
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn
with
some
slight
alterations
and
intermixed
with
other
preexisting
costumes
from
Slavers
Bay
see
Costumes
The
Seven
Kingdoms
The
Vale
of
Arryn
Notice
that
the
Volantene
envoys
costume
is
the
same
style
that
the
characters
in
Littlefingers
scene
from
this
episode
are
also
wearing
just
with
some
more
jewelry
and
a
few
pieces
changed
up
Given
the
increased
budget
for
Season
compared
to
previous
time
constraints
it
is
unclear
why
the
costume
department
didnt
invent
a
new
Volantene
style
from
scratch
Then
again
Clapton
left
the
TV
series
after
Season
and
was
replaced
this
season
by
April
Ferry
as
head
costume
designer
it
is
possible
that
Ferry
was
simply
trying
to
be
accurate
to
the
previously
established
Volantene
look
from
Season
when
she
designed
the
costume
of
this
envoy
not
realizing
that
the
Volantene
style
in
Season
was
simply
a
kitbash
of
the
Vale
and
Meereen
The
description
of
the
layout
of
Vaes
Dothrak
which
Jorah
gives
directly
matches
the
novels
the
main
road
leading
through
the
Horse
Gate
with
the
large
horse
statues
is
called
the
Godsway
because
it
is
lined
with
the
broken
idols
of
the
gods
of
peoples
the
Dothraki
have
conquered
which
separates
the
Western
Market
and
the
Eastern
Market
Daenerys
visited
the
markets
back
in
Season
You
Win
or
You
Die
The
Dothraki
are
not
merchants
themselves
and
look
down
on
trade
so
the
merchants
in
the
two
markets
are
actually
foreigners
they
dont
come
to
trade
with
the
Dothraki
but
for
caravans
from
the
west
and
east
to
trade
with
each
other
avoiding
the
heavy
taxes
that
Qarth
exacts
on
sea
shipping
Notice
that
Jorah
specifically
says
they
will
claim
they
are
from
the
Western
Market
the
Western
Market
is
run
by
merchants
from
the
west
ie
the
Free
Cities
but
the
Eastern
Market
is
run
by
peoples
from
the
Further
East
such
as
Yi
Ti
in
fact
the
Yi
Tish
merchants
that
Daenerys
observes
in
Vaes
Dothrak
are
the
only
time
in
the
current
novels
that
any
Yi
Tish
characters
have
directly
appear
in
the
narrative
People
from
Yi
Ti
are
East
Asian
in
appearance
Martin
has
stated
that
it
is
loosely
this
fantasyworlds
analogue
of
Imperial
China
Thus
Jorah
says
they
will
claim
they
are
merchants
from
specifically
the
Western
Market
because
they
cant
plausibly
be
from
the
Eastern
Market
as
they
obviously
dont
look
Yi
Tish
In
the
novels
Vaes
Dothraki
is
described
as
a
city
of
tents
with
a
handful
of
permanent
wooden
structures
such
as
the
Temple
of
the
dosh
khaleen
It
generally
had
this
appearance
when
it
was
introduced
in
Season
The
alleys
that
Jorah
and
Daario
make
their
way
through
in
this
episode
however
are
formed
by
more
permanent
buildings
of
mud
brick
Daario
remarks
on
a
Dothraki
couple
having
sex
in
public
at
a
feast
as
previously
explained
the
Dothraki
think
it
is
silly
to
consider
the
naked
body
shameful
and
because
entire
khalasars
are
on
the
move
together
they
dont
really
consider
sex
to
be
something
that
needs
to
be
hidden
away
in
private
Both
the
novels
and
the
TV
series
in
Season
made
it
a
point
that
the
Dothraki
usually
prefer
to
have
rearentry
position
Doggystyle
sex
yet
the
Dothraki
man
and
woman
in
this
episode
are
clearly
having
sex
in
the
Suspended
Congress
position
Some
of
the
assembled
Dothraki
khals
decorate
themselves
with
bodypaint
of
different
colors
Rhalko
uses
brown
stripes
another
uses
black
etc
Khal
Drogo
used
blue
paint
The
production
team
came
up
with
the
idea
that
the
Dothraki
decorate
themselves
with
various
paints
made
from
crushed
rocks
and
Drogo
used
blue
because
it
is
the
most
expensive
Different
khalasars
however
use
different
colors
to
distinguish
themselves
ie
Khal
Jhaqos
horse
seen
in
Season
s
The
Night
Lands
used
red
paint
stripes
George
RR
Martin
stated
that
in
the
novels
Daenerys
Targaryen
is
not
immune
to
fire
under
normal
circumstances
The
hatching
of
her
dragons
from
Khal
Drogos
funeral
pyre
was
a
onetime
magical
event
in
part
due
to
the
rule
of
Blood
magic
that
only
life
can
pay
for
life
she
needed
to
burn
Mirri
Maz
Duur
alive
on
the
funeral
pyre
as
a
sacrifice
to
give
the
dragons
life
The
showrunners
in
the
Inside
the
Episode
featurette
seem
to
believe
Daenerys
is
always
fireproof
The
nature
of
her
relationship
with
fire
is
mysterious
and
ambiguous
in
the
novels
Daenerys
herself
isnt
certain
whether
she
is
fireproof
and
doesnt
test
it
again
by
jumping
into
another
funeral
pyre
In
the
next
unpublished
novel
she
might
indeed
again
miraculously
survive
a
fire
unburned
As
when
Daenerys
emerged
from
the
fire
unburned
in
Fire
and
Blood
Daeneryss
hair
remains
unburned
In
the
novels
her
hair
was
burned
off
and
took
months
to
grow
back
Practically
it
looks
much
more
dramatic
if
Dany
keeps
her
signature
hair
so
the
team
apparently
decided
to
let
that
detail
slide
Emilia
Clarke
confirmed
that
she
actually
appears
nude
in
the
final
scene
without
a
body
double
having
not
done
a
nude
scene
since
Season
The
lighting
of
the
shot
doesnt
exactly
match
the
background
which
might
lead
to
the
assumption
that
they
digitally
added
her
head
onto
a
body
double
as
was
done
with
Cersei
in
the
Season
finale
Actually
the
reason
the
lighting
is
slightly
mismatched
is
because
Clarke
filmed
the
closeup
nude
scenes
on
a
closed
set
not
the
large
onlocation
set
in
Spain
with
hundreds
of
extras
in
the
crowd
and
also
of
course
because
she
couldnt
actually
be
standing
unburned
in
the
middle
of
a
raging
fire
In
postproduction
the
closeup
shots
of
her
entire
body
were
then
digitally
inserted
into
the
larger
set
Daniel
Sackheim
directed
both
this
episode
and
the
preceding
one
which
began
by
showing
the
immediate
result
of
Jon
Snows
resurrection
as
he
rises
up
from
the
table
at
Castle
Black
In
the
Behind
the
Thrones
featurette
for
this
episode
Sackheim
explained
that
he
wanted
Jons
scene
in
the
preceding
episode
and
Daeneryss
closing
scene
in
this
episode
to
parallel
each
other
both
of
them
are
symbolically
being
reborn
and
thus
both
of
them
are
naked
to
parallel
being
born
as
an
infant
All
of
Daeneryss
clothes
were
burned
away
and
she
was
symbolically
reborn
in
the
flames
while
Jon
literally
returned
to
life
his
body
stripped
naked
so
Melisandre
could
clean
all
of
the
blood
away
While
the
scenes
parallel
each
other
Sackheim
also
intended
a
contrast
Jons
rebirth
happens
in
the
frozen
north
at
the
Wall
in
a
room
so
cold
his
breath
is
visible
while
Daeneryss
rebirth
is
from
a
raging
inferno
ie
Jon
is
reborn
amid
ice
and
Daenerys
is
reborn
amid
fire
as
in
the
title
of
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novel
series
which
the
TV
series
adapts
Osha
hasnt
returned
with
Rickon
Stark
yet
in
the
novels
and
it
is
doubtful
that
she
will
be
killed
by
Ramsay
Bolton
or
at
least
Rickons
capture
is
a
condensation
so
it
seems
unlikely
she
will
die
in
this
specific
manner
though
she
might
still
die
fighting
Bolton
forces
In
the
books
Osha
took
Rickon
to
the
island
of
Skagos
off
the
east
coast
of
the
North
a
semiindependent
isle
only
nominally
part
of
the
North
considered
to
practically
be
wildlings
themselves
feared
as
savage
raiders
and
rumored
cannibals
So
far
they
havent
returned
though
in
his
last
chapter
in
the
most
recent
novel
Davos
Seaworth
learns
that
Rickon
and
Osha
are
hiding
there
and
he
intends
to
retrieve
them
Oshas
death
scene
does
flow
logically
for
the
situation
as
Ramsay
says
Theon
would
have
told
him
everything
about
the
Stark
boys
escape
under
torture
so
hed
know
that
Osha
was
specifically
trying
to
seduce
him
to
kill
him
That
being
said
George
RR
Martin
pointed
out
that
even
in
Season
Osha
in
the
TV
series
was
very
different
from
Osha
in
the
novels
who
is
older
more
stoic
and
not
as
sarcastic
In
fact
TVOsha
was
one
of
the
very
rare
cases
in
which
Martin
said
that
from
Season
he
actually
enjoyed
the
TV
version
better
than
the
minor
character
Osha
is
in
the
novels
in
no
small
part
due
to
the
strength
of
Natalia
Tenas
performance
This
is
why
they
gave
her
more
screentime
in
Season
and
why
she
was
even
brought
back
for
Season
in
the
novels
Osha
leaves
Bran
right
after
escaping
Winterfell
but
the
TV
version
kept
her
around
until
they
arrived
at
the
Wall
Thus
while
Oshas
death
may
be
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
most
of
TVOsha
was
itself
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
she
wasnt
this
prominent
of
a
character
in
the
novels
to
begin
with
When
Ramsay
asks
Osha
if
the
Bolton
sigil
and
the
idea
of
flaying
frightens
her
she
counters
by
asking
if
he
eats
his
victims
as
well
a
question
which
seems
to
actually
take
him
aback
Osha
is
most
likely
referring
to
the
Thenns
and
their
cannibalistic
tendencies
Its
also
possible
that
this
is
an
oblique
reference
to
Oshas
storyline
in
the
novels
rather
than
Last
Hearth
she
took
Rickon
to
Skagos
The
novels
hint
that
she
may
have
been
there
before
and
the
inhabitants
of
Skagos
are
rumored
to
also
be
cannibals
The
Bastard
Letter
The
episode
introduces
the
notorious
Bastard
letter
that
Jon
receives
from
Ramsay
near
the
end
of
the
fifth
novel
in
which
Jons
reaction
to
it
is
actually
what
leads
to
the
mutiny
against
him
In
the
show
no
doubt
is
introduced
that
Ramsay
wrote
the
letter
for
its
contents
are
consistent
with
the
previous
scenes
In
the
book
however
there
are
several
anomalies
about
it
the
most
conspicuous
is
that
no
piece
of
skin
is
enclosed
like
most
of
Ramsays
letters
which
led
to
fan
speculations
that
it
was
not
Ramsay
who
wrote
it
A
line
from
Ramsays
letter
was
spoken
by
Iwan
Rheon
in
one
of
the
first
teasers
for
the
sixth
season
Winterfell
is
mine
Come
and
see
Though
in
the
letter
the
line
is
Winterfell
is
mine
bastard
Come
and
see
the
bastard
was
omitted
to
hide
the
spoiler
that
Ramsay
was
saying
it
to
Jon
Snow
who
at
the
time
was
believed
dead
It
did
however
serve
as
a
spoiler
regarding
Roose
Bolton
who
would
have
to
be
dead
in
order
for
Ramsay
to
claim
that
Winterfell
was
his
and
not
Rooses

The
developmental
level
of
science

in
Westeros
and
The

World
as
a

is
roughly
comparable
to
reallife
late

Contentsshow
General
Author
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
the
storyline
in
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
is
partially
and
loosely
inspired
by
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
the
dynastic
conflict
that
occurred
in
England
intermittently
between
and
following
the
countrys
defeat
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
as
well
as
Maurice
Druons
novels
The
Accursed
Kings
about
the
history
of
the
French
Kings
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
Hundred
Years
War
Just
as
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
fought
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
the
conflict
in
Game
of
Thrones
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
The
technology
level
in
their
society
more
or
less
matches
late
medieval
Europe
ie
right
before
the
use
of
gunpowder
and
cannons
revolutionized
medieval
warfare
and
brought
it
into
the
Early
Modern
era
Magic
was
prevalent
in
the
world
in
the
longdistant
past
but
for
many
centuries
magical
power
has
dwindled
in
the
world
as
has
knowledge
of
its
use
While
a
handful
of
odd
cults
still
believe
in
magic
such
as
the
Alchemists
GuildandWarlocks
of
Qarth
they
can
do
little
to
substantiate
their
claims
The
general
population
considers
magic
to
have
never
existed
at
all
and
to
be
simply
mythical
a
view
promoted
by
the
Order
of
Maesters
who
champion
a
world
based
on
science
and
reason
and
scorn
the
very
idea
of
magic
The
mighty
Valyrian
Freehold
was
built
using
the
powerful
dragons
who
were
rumored
to
share
a
deep
link
with
magic
However
most
dragons
were
killed
in
the
Doom
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
before
the
narrative
of
Game
of
Thrones
begins
and
even
the
last
dragons
which
belonged
to
House
Targaryen
died
almost
two
centuries
ago
largely
used
up
in
a

Science
and
technology
have
not
significantly
advanced
in
the
past
several
centuries
Recorded
history
is
indeed
vastly
longer
in
the
fantasy
world
than
in
reallife
For
example
the
Valyrian
Freehold
existed
for
an
astonishing
five
thousand
years
before
its
fall
Written
history
in
Westeros
began
with
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
albeit
much
of
this
is
fragmentary
and
biased

Timeline
It
is
possible
that
in
earlier
ages
when
magic
was
more
prevalent
there
was
less
drive
to
innovate
new
tools
with
science
leaving
technology
levels
static
for
many
centuries
Even
so
while
the
general
rule
holds
that
gunpowder
has
not
been
discovered
there
is
not
a
oneforone
correspondence
between
the
technology
level
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
and
the
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
For
example
certain
medical
knowledge
is
much
more
advanced
and
accurate
in
Westeros
than
it
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
partially
because
certain
discoveries
in
history
have
been
accidental
ie
penicillin
not
the
culmination
of
a
long
aggregation
of
previous
discoveries
The
people
in
Westeros
and
beyond
are
also
capable
of
producing
vast
feats
of
architecture
such
as
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
without
the
use
of
magic
at
all
Martin
has
stated
that
medical
knowledge
is
officially
more
advanced
in
Westeros
than
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
I
made
a
deliberate
decision
when
the
books
began
to
have
the
maesters
and
have
Westeros
in
general
have
better
medical
knowledge
than
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
Mostly
because
I
didnt
want
everybody
dying
at
twentysix
So
it
is
generally
improved
the
maesters
have
improved
the
standard
of
hygiene
and
they
understand
certain
practices
and
they
can
do
things
better
Also
they
have
magic
While
this
might
seem
incongruent
with
the
otherwise
static
medieval
level
of
technology
in
Westeros
much
of
reallife
medical
knowledge
was
discovered
purely
through
trial
and
error
or
even
by
accident
such
as
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
The
maesters
might
not
know
the
underlying
theoretical
reasons
behind
illnesses
what
bacteria
and
viruses
are
but
they
have
accumulated
a
more
advanced
level
of
functional
medical
knowledge
for
practical
purposes
such
as
what
herb
mixtures
will
heal
infections
better
surgical
procedures
etc
Medicine
See
main

Medicine
Military
Technology
See

Armament
Military
technology
in
Westeros
and
Essos
is
loosely
comparable
to
the
kinds
used
during
the
reallife
Hundred
Years
War
and
War
of
the
Roses
Crossbows
are
prevalent
though
they
have
not
superseded
longbows
which
are
also
quite
common
on
the
battlefield
again
much
like
the
s
in
reallife
northwestern
Europe
Various
kinds
of
advanced
siege
weapons
such
as
catapults
are
employed
Horse
cavalry
are
widely
used
and
some
regions
of
Essos
are
known
to
use
mounted
elephants
Heavy
cavalry
using
mounted
knights
in
full
plate
armor
is
a
mainstay
of
the
battlefield
though
they
are
more
commonly
fielded
by
the
wealthier
regions
of
Westeros
ie
the
Reach
or
the
Westerlands
while
the
poorer
kingdoms
such
as
The
North
or
the
Iron
Islands
make
do
with
chain
mail
instead
of
full
plate
armor
Many
armies
frequently
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
mercenaries
Valyrian
steel
is
a
type
of
metal
forged
in
the
oncemighty
Valyrian
Freehold
used
to
make
swords
that
are
exceptionally
sharp
and
tremendously
strong
The
knowledge
of
how
to
create
Valyrian
steel
was
lost
in
the
fall
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
ago
making
the
few
surviving
Valyrian
steel
swords
incredibly
rare
and
expensive
Valyrian
steel
is
rumored
to
have
been
forged
with
the
aid
of
magic
spells
and
dragonfire
Gunpowder
does
not
exist
in
the
medieval
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
They
do
possess
Wildfire
a
highly
flammable
and
explosive
napalmlike
substance
the
Alchemists
Guild
refuses
to
divulge
how
wildfire
is
created
but
claim
that
it
is
done
with
magical
spells
a
claim
dismissed
by
others
particularly
the
maesters
Even
so
Wildfire
is
similar
to
real
life
Greek
fire
which
was
actually
used
by
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
medieval
times
and
thus
was
actually
a
technology
known
to
medieval
peoples
and
thus
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
for
a
medieval
setting
Dragons
were
of
course
used
in
warfare
but
they
are
more
of
a
magicbased
fantasy
creature
Moreover
the
last
known
dragons
in
the
world
died
out
two
hundred
years
ago
largely
due
to
many
of
them
being
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
in
which
dragons
were
used
to
kill
other
dragons
Thus
dragons
have
not
been
used
on
the
battlefield
in
two
centuries
Ships

Currency
See
main
article
Currency
Several
different
types
of
currency
are
used
in
the
worlds
various
economies
The
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros
have
a
uniform
system
of
coinage
based
on
the
Gold
Dragon
coin
The
different
cities
and
nations
across
the
Narrow
Sea
on
Essos
use
their
own
various
local
currencies
Books
and
writing
Different
societies
have
their
own
writing
systems
The
main
one
encountered
is
the
one
used
for
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
throughout
Westeros
The
Andals
introduced
the
first
full
writing
system
to
Westeros
the
First
Men
before
them
only
used
a
basic
rune
script
for
the
Old
Tongue
which
was
only
used
for
basic
inscriptions
on
grave
markers
etc
The
Dothraki
do
not
have
a
written
language
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
the
Valyrian
languages
in
the
Free
Cities
and
Slavers
Bay
have
their
own
glyphbased
writing
systems
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
represent
this
in
the
TV
series
The
novels
refer
to
characters
in
Westeros
using
both
parchment
made
from
animal
skins
and
paper
made
from
wood
pulp
This
is
not
incongruous
to
the
setting
paper
was
introduced
to
real
life
Western
Europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
though
it
did
not
surpass
use
of
parchment
for
many
centuries
Generally
parchment
was
still
used
for
important
documents
legal
charters
important
diplomatic
messages
etc
while
paper
was
a
cheap
less
durable
alternative
Given
that
Westeros
is
loosely
based
on
the
War
of
the
Roses
in
England
during
the
s
it
is
not
contradictory
that
their
society
uses
a
mix
of
paper
or
parchment
for
different
tasks
Paper
seems
to
be
often
used
for
more
common
tasks
the
messages
sent
via
the
raven
network
are
described
as
being
written
on
little
scrolls
of
paper
paper
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
parchment
so
it
is
probably
easier
to
roll
easier
to
fit
more
writing
on
each
roll
and
easier
for
the
birds
to
carry
More
important
handdelivered
messages
tend
to
be
written
on
parchment
particularly
royal
decrees
from
Kings
Landing
Most
if
not
all
books
are
made
out
of
parchment
not
paper
books
are
usually
commissioned
or
handcopied
and
thus
more
like
luxury
items
so
anyone
commissioning
one
will
have
it
made
of
high
quality
They
dont
have
cheap
massproduced
paper
books
No
mention
has
been
made
of
printing
press
technology
and
it
apparently
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
and
probably
not
in
Essos
either
The
printing
press
was
only
introduced
in
reallife
Medieval
Europe
in
the
mids
and
took
time
to
be
implemented
again
matching
the
general
historical
period
of
the
setting
It
is
unknown
if
other
societies
use
earlier
forms
of
printing
such
as
woodblock
printing
etc

Measurement
Measurements
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
are
given
in
imperial
measurements
As
they
are
a
medieval
society
their
systems
of
measurements
weights
and
coinage
grew
haphazardly
out
of
local
customs
instead
of
any
rational
basis
For
example
the
Wall
is
miles
long
and
feet
tall
converted
to
the
metric
system
for
the
benefit
of
some
viewers
the
Wall
is
kilometers
long
and
between
and
meters
tall
Weights
are
rarely
mentioned
in
the
TV
series
but
it
has
been
said
that
pounds
tons
and
ounces
are
used
to
measure
them
These
are
also
nonmetric
units
as
kilograms
do
not
exist
as
a
unit
in
Westeros
in
the
books
the
old
nonmetric
unit
of
stones
is
also
used
one
stone
equals
about
pounds
Smaller
distances
can
be
measured
in
yards
Animals
and
Plants
See
main
article
Animals
and
Plants
Several
notable
animal
and
plant
species
exist
in
Westeros
and
the
Known
World
Some
of
these
have
no
real
world
counterparts
but
many
are
based
on
ice
age
megafauna
which
did
exist
in
reallife
but
went
extinct
thousands
of
years
ago
On
the
whole
it
is
very
unusual
to
encounter
animals
that
are
significantly
different
than
encountered
in
reallife
medieval
Europe
and
the
Near
East
A
few
animals
have
no
oneforone
counterpart
with
real
life
ones
ie
shadowcats
are
common
animals
somewhere
in
size
between
a
cougar
and
a
tiger
but
not
exactly
like
either
In
general
however
even
direwolves
are
a
very
rare
and
unusual
animal
for
the
inhabitants
of
Westeros
to
encounter
in
keeping
with
George
RR
Martins
attempts
to
create
a
more
realistic
gritty
fantasy
world
Animals
Dragons
winged
reptiles
of
tremendous
age
and
ferocity
capable
of
breathing
fire
Originated
in
the
east
and
enslaved
by
the
Valyrians
who
used
them
to
forge
their
empire
Most
dragons
were
destroyed
in
the
Doom
four
centuries
ago
leaving
the
few
possessed
by
House
Targaryen
as
the
only
surviving
dragons
in
the
world
which
they
used
in
their
invasion
of
Westeros
The
last
Targaryen
dragons
died
over
years
ago
The
skulls
of
more
than
a
dozen
dragons
are
kept
in
the
Red
Keep
Direwolves
a
larger
cousin
of
regular
wolves
only
found
north
of
the
Wall
In
the
south
they
are
considered
nearmythical
Occasional
sightings
of
direwolves
have
been
reported
by
the
Nights
Watch
but
at
the
time
the
series
starts
there
have
been
no
confirmed
sightings
south
of
the
Wall
for
centuries
Horses
A
common
animal
bred
all
over
Westeros
commonly
used
as
methods
of
transport
Krakens
massive
cephalopods
that
stalk
the
worlds
oceans
So
rare
that
they
are
largely
held
to
be
mythical
though
sailors
occasionally
report
seeing
them

Shouldnt
the

be
removed

talk
June

Not
yet
Just
like
Dragonstone
was
still
loyal
to
House
Targaryen
after
the
Sack
of
Kings
Landing
the
castellen
of
The
Dreadfort
whomever
that
is
is
still
presumably
loyal
to
House
Bolton
though
that
house
is
now
extinct
Some
Stark
loyal
soldiers
need
to
rideup
and
try
and
take
the
fort
which
will
probably
hard
for
them
to
do
considering
the
massive
losses
they
just
took
Plus
who
is
going
to
take
over
the
fort
In
short
it
is
too
early
to
take
down
the
Bolton
shields
for
The
Dreafort

June
UTC
We
honestly
dont
know
how
it
will
go
on
with
the
Dreadfort
right
Maybe
well
hear
in
the
upcoming
episode
that
the
castellan
has
given
up
maybe
hell
stay
behind
the
walls
Even
the
books
cant
tell
us
more
because
in
them
both
Boltons
Roose
and
Ramsay
are
still
alive
Maybe
another
Bolton
appears
and
claims
it
or
another
noble
house
will
claim
it
I
doubt
that
Jon
and
Sansa
will
march
to
this
fortress
because
its
as
hard
to
conquer
like
Winterfell
and
now
theyve
lost
their
giant

Dont
you
think
Sansa
would
be
the
new
overlord
of
the
Dreadfort
Since
she
did
marry
Ramsay
wouldnt
the
remaining
garrison
of
the

submit

The
Gift
is
a
region
to
the
south
of
the
Wall
under
the
control
of
the
Nights
Watch
It
lies
at
the
northern
edge
of
the
region
known
as
the
North
It
was
donated
to
the
Nights
Watch
by
House
Stark
when
the
order
was
founded
thousands
of
years
ago
in
order
to
support
the
Nights
Watch
with
food
and
provisions
The
Gift
is
officially
not
subject
to
the
authority
of
Winterfell
and
is
technically
not
part
of
the
North
but
is
a
special
administrative
zone
directly
ruled
by
the
Nights
Watch
Culturally
and
socially
however
the
lightly
inhabited
villages
of
the
Gift
are
usually
seen
as
just
an
extension
of
the
North
By
definition
the
Gift
is
ruled
by
the
Nights
Watch
and
thus
contains
no
noble
Houses
Therefore
no
special
bastard
surname
was
ever
developed
for
the
region
because
these
are
legally
only
used
by
the
bastard
children
of
nobles

History
The
Gift
is
held
to
be
as
old
as
the
Wall
itself
which
according
to
legend
was
raised
years
ago
The
region
is
called
the
Gift
because
it
was
given
to
the
Nights
Watch
as
a
gift
of
land
for
their
sustenance
and
support
from
which
the
Watch
could
draw
a
steady
supply
of
food
livestock
firewood
etc
The
myths
say
that
Brandon
the
Builder
himself
the
founder
of
House
Stark
and
builder
of
the
Wall
is
the
one
who
gifted
these
lands
to
the
Watch
Geography
The
Gift
extends
south
of
the
Wall
The
Gift
extends
immediately
south
of
the
Wall
stretching
from
the
eastern
to
western
coasts
of
Westeros
The
southern
border
is
roughly
at
the
same
parallel
as
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
of
Skagos
slightly
further
north
than
the
northern
edge
of
Bear
Island
The
Kingsroad
runs
through
the
middle
of
the
Gift
as
it
passes
from
Winterfell
to
Castle
Black
The
Gift
is
bordered
to
the
south
by
the
lands
of
House
Umber
which
are
centered
on
their
castleseat
at
Last
Hearth
As
the
northernmost
noble
House
of
the
the
North
and
the
Seven
Kingdoms
as
a
whole
the
Umbers
often
have
to
lead
armies
into
the
Gift
to
repel
wildling
raiding
parties
The
Gift
contains
farmland
meant
to
sustain
the
Nights
Watch
The
westernmost
portion
of
the
Gift
is
rough
mountainous
country
a
continuation
of
the
Frostfang
Mountains
whose
main
range
is
north
of
the
Wall
The
southern
Frostfangs
continue
south
through
the
Gift
until
tapering
off
into
the
North
itself
While
cold
the
Gift
still
contains
good
arable
land
far
away
from
the
wars
of
southern
Westeros
As
the
Nights
Watch
declined
over
the
centuries
however
increasing
wildling
raids
over
or
around
the
Wall
have
caused
the
lands
of
the
Gift
closest
to
the
Wall
to
be
largely
abandoned
Even
the
Gift
as
a
whole
is
lightly
populated
with
vast
open
stretches
of
abandoned
countryside
dotted
by
the
occasional
ruin
of
an
old
village
The
abandoned
town
of
Queenscrown
lies
within
the
Gift
The
closest
inhabited
village
to
the
Wall
within
the
Gift
in
which
common
peasants
actually
live
is
Moles
Town
which
is
located
along
the
Kingsroad
a
short
distance
from
Castle
Black
Despite
its
name
Moles
Town
isnt
really
a
large
market
town
of
the
scale
found
in
southern
Westeros
while
it
is
apparently
the
largest
settlement
in
the
Gift
by
the
standards
of
southern
Westeros
it
is
only
a
small
filthy
hardscrabble
village

the
New
Gift
in

In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Gift
was
donated
to
the
Nights
Watch
by
King
Brandon
Stark
popularly
believed
to
be
Bran
the
Builder
though
maesters
believe
it
was
a
different
Brandon
The
Targaryen
Conquest
did
little
to
change
this
nominally
the
Gift
is
part
of
the
unified
realm
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
under
the
Iron
Throne
but
in
practice
the
Targaryen
kings
respected
the
strict
noninterference
rules
of
the
Nights
Watch
allowing
the
Watch
to
continue
to
functionally
control
the
Gift
without
royal
oversight
The
Gift
originally
extended
for
twentyfive
leagues
seventyfive
miles
south
of
the
Wall
This
was
doubled
some
two
centuries
ago
when
Queen
Alysanne
Targaryen
the
sisterwife
of
King
Jaehaerys
the
Conciliator
visited
the
Wall
on
the
back
of
her
dragon
Silverwing
Impressed
with
the
valor
bravery
and
loyalty
of
the
Nights
Watch
Alysanne
urged
her
husband
to
extend
the
Gift
He
did
so
by
adding
the
New
Gift
to
the
existing
territory
The
New
Gift
extends
for
an
additional
twentyfive
leagues
to
the
south
giving
the
Nights
Watch
control
of
all
the
lands
from
coast
to
coast
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
south
of
the
Wall
It
is
unclear
if
the
Brandons
Gift
originally
had
smallfolk
living
on
it
or
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
worked
by
stewards
of
the
Nights
Watch
In
either
case
the
addition
of
the
New
Gift
added
a
population
of
smallfolk
to
the
Gift
some
of
which
may
have
moved
north
into
Brandons
Gift
only
to
then
be
mostly
driven
back
south
later
in
time
by
increasing
wildling
attacks
The
declining
numbers
of
the
Nights
Watch
have
reduced
their
ability
to
both
hold
the
Wall
and
defend
the
villagers
of
the
Gift
from
the
small
wildling
parties
that
are
sometimes
able
to
bypass
the
Wall
by
either
climbing
over
lightlydefended
areas
or
going
around
by
sea
As
a
result
the
Gift
is
lightlysettled
close
to
the
Wall
with
more
farms
and
villages
located
in
the
New
Gift
close
to
the
lands
of
House
Umber
The
most
notable
incursion
into
the
Gift
was
by
Raymun
Redbeard
the
KingBeyondtheWall
of
more
than
a
century
ago
who
reached
Long
Lake
before
being
defeated
by
the
armies
of
House
Stark
Brandons
Gift
extending
twenty
five
leagues
south
of
the
Wall
is
said
to
be
almost
entirely
abandoned
by
the
time
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Moles
Town
however
is
located
only
half
a
league
south
of
Castle
Black
along
the
Kingsroad
and
is
therefore
within
Brandons
Gift
It
is
possible
that
the
few
remaining
smallfolk
clustered
around
the
Kingsroad
because
military
response
from
Castle
Black
or
Winterfell
against
wildling
attacks
could
reach
them
more
quickly
along
the
major
highway
The
Gift
may
appear
small
on
a
map
of
Westeros
but
its
marginal
population
means
that
it
is
filled
with
vast
open
spaces
It
is
also
one
of
the
few
regions
in
Westeros
for
which
the
land
area
can
be
calculated
with
reasonable
certainty
the
Wall
is
miles
long
on
its
northern
border
and
its
southern
border
widens
somewhat
and
the
Gift
extends
for
leagues
south
of
the
Wall
one
league
equaling
about
three
miles
This
makes
the
total
land
area
of
the
Gift
at
least
square
miles
x
which
is
larger
than
real
life

bring

Season
Yara

Yara
carries

of

Theon
She

and

soldiers
use

At

Yara
informs

father
that

have
retaken

executed
the
ironborn
garrison
stationed
there
With
the
loss
of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses
the
Unsullied
to
lay
siege
to
Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara
realises
that
Euron
has
come
On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in

his
plank
onto
the

and
they
begin
duelling

her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

At
Pyke
Yara
informs
her
father
that
the
Glovers
have
retaken
Deepwood
Motte
and
executed
the
ironborn
garrison
stationed
there
With
the
loss
of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses
the
Unsullied
to
lay
siege
to
Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara
realises
that
Euron
has
come
On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in

her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Scenes
In

On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara

on

Greyjoy
and
The

After

Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point

is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute

the

Yara
reasons

is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of

Following

she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses
the
Unsullied
to
lay
siege
to
Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara
realises
that
Euron
has
come
On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in

As
Euron
lowers
his
plank
onto
the

protect
her
mother
who
is
still
below

over

burning
fleet
she
has
a
moment
of
despair
before
once

engaging
into

Euron
holds
Yara
hostage
After
he
kills
Obara
and
Nymeria
Sand
Euron
locks
eyes
with
Yara
and
they
begin
duelling
Despite
her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

At

Motte
and
executed
the
ironborn
garrison
stationed
there
With
the
loss
of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses
the
Unsullied
to
lay
siege
to
Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara
realises
that
Euron
has
come
On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in

his
plank
onto

protect
her
mother
who
is

below

burning
fleet
she
has

moment

holds
Yara
hostage
After
he
kills
Obara
and
Nymeria

Euron
locks
eyes
with
Yara
and
they
begin
duelling
Despite
her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

garrison
stationed
there
With
the
loss
of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should

attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses
the
Unsullied
to
lay
siege
to
Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara
realises
that
Euron
has
come
On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in
battle
As
Euron
lowers
his
plank
onto
the
Black
Wind
the
invasion
begins
Filled
with
bloodlust
and
revenge
for
her
father
Yara
successfully
kills
many
of
Eurons
ironborn
She
tells
Tyene
Sand
midbattle
to
protect
her
mother
who
is
still
below
decks
Looking
over
her
burning
fleet
she
has
a
moment
of
despair
before
once
agian
engaging
into
battle
Euron
holds
Yara
hostage
After
he
kills
Obara
and
Nymeria
Sand
Euron
locks
eyes
with
Yara
and
they
begin
duelling
Despite
her
skillful
style
of
attack
Euron
overpowers
his
niece
and
holds
his
axe
to
her
throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

garrison
stationed

With
the

of
Deepwood
Motte
the
last
major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens
massive
invasion
force
Season
Upon
arriving
on
Dragonstone
with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by
Yara
while
Olenna
Tyrells
army
attacks
from
the
west
Tyrion
then
uses

Casterly
Rock
Yara
agrees
to
the
plan
and
sets
sail
for
Dorne
Yara

On
the
Black
Wind
Yara
and
Ellaria
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
sexuality
of
Dorne
and
then
begin
to
flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by
fire
and
looking
up
at
the
Silence
above
them
Yara
knows
that
it
is
Euron
Yara
meets
Euron
in

As
Euron
lowers
his
plank
onto
the

Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for
Theon
Yara
is
taken
below
decks
by
Euron
as
they
sail
away
en
route
to
Kings
Landing
on
the
Silence
Euron
parades
Yara
through
Kings
Landing
Following
Eurons
assault
on
the
Targaryen
fleet
Yara
along
with
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
led
in
chains
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
by
her
triumphant
uncle
Yara
and
the
Dornish
women
are
pelted
with
rotten
fruits
by
the
smallfolk
Euron
mockingly
tells
his
niece
that
they
are
receiving
a
heros
welcome
Yara
and
her
fellow
captives
are
brought
before
Queen
Cersei
who
appoints
Euron
as
the
commander
of
her
naval
forces
While
Ellaria
and
Tyene
are
left
with
Cersei
to
face
her
wrath
for
murdering
her
daughter
Myrcella
Yara
is
led
away
by
armed
guards
Upon
Theons
return
to
Dragonstone
he
asks
to
see
Daenerys
to
request
her
help
in
rescuingYara
but
is
told
by
Jon
Snow
that
she
has
already
left
Following
the
parley
in
Kings
Landing
Theon
rallies
the
remaining
ironborn
loyal
to
Yara
into
a
mounting
a
rescue
mission
just
as
Yara
did
to
save
him
Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
She
rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated
by
Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras
sexuality
books
vs
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

the

major
ironborn
fortress
in
the
North
Yara
reasons
that
the
ironborn
invasion
is
a
doomed
cause
Yara
confronts
Balon
about
House
Greyjoys
future
When
Balon
insists
on
continuing
the
fight
Yara
argues
that
while
the
ironborn
are
unparalleled
in
naval
warfare
they
fare
poorly
on
land
especially
against
a
much
larger
mainland
host
During
their
conversation
Balon
chastises
his
daughter
for
wasting
men
on
trying
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Dreadfort
Yara
refuses
to
apologize
for
her
rescue
attempt
but
tries
to
convince
her
father
to
end
their
rebellion
against
the
mainland
She
points
out
that
they
were
only
able
to
take
the
strongholds
in
the
North
because
the
Northern
lords
were
fighting
a
war
in
the
South
Now
that
the
war
is
over
the
northerners
are
taking
back
their
strongholds
from
the
ironborn
Yara
then
reminds
her
father
that
the
last
time
they
pushed
the
Northerners
too
far
they
were
defeated
and
she
lost
her
two
older
brothers
Balon
angrily
responds
that
he
lost
three
sons
that
day
and
warns
Yara
that
he
will
replace
her
with
another
heir
if
she
does
not
obey
The
two
part
company
and
Balon
is
subsequently
murdered
by
his
estranged
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
Yara
and
Aeron
discuss
the
upcoming
Kingsmoot
at
her
fathers
funeral
Balons
body
is
discovered
after
the
storm
and
the
following
day
Yara
attends
his
seaside
funeral
overseen
by
her
uncle
Aeron
Greyjoy
one
of
the
Drowned
Men
Following
the
funeral
she
vows
to
avenge
her
fathers
death
by
finding
whoever
is
responsible
and
feeding
them
to
the
sharks
while
theyre
still
alive
When
Yara
announces
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
reminds
his
niece
that
the
Kingsmoot
chooses
the
next
ruler
While
Balon
wanted
his
daughter
to
succeed
him
Aeron
firmly
points
out
that
Balon
does
not
make
the
rules
Aeron
says
that
perhaps
she
will
win
the
Kingsmoot
and
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
rule
the
Iron
Islands
but
then
again
perhaps
not
When
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Yara
berates
him
for
betraying
her
at
the
Dreadfort
She
suggests
that
Theons
arrival
just
before
the
Kingsmoot
signals
his
desire
to
be
king
which
he
denies
After
pressuring
Theon
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
he
tells
her
that
he
wants
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
Yara
and
Theon
during
the
Kingsmoot
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
the
first
to
claim
the
Salt
Throne
She
initially
gains
the
support
of
those
gathered
citing
her
experience
leading
the
Ironborn
and
as
a
sea
warrior
However
one
man
does
not
support
her
claim
due
to
her
gender
and
Theons
return
This
remark
prompts
Theon
to
speak
about
Yaras
bravery
and
legitimacy
to
rule
His
speech
convinces
most
of
the
Ironborn
but
just
as
the
Kingsmoot
is
about
to
close
Euron
arrives
He
lays
claim
and
Yara
accuses
him
of
murdering
Balon
Euron
admits
his
kinslaying
but
successfully
convinces
the
Ironborn
that
their
former
king
was
holding
them
back
from
greatness
Euron
wins
the
Kingsmoot
by
proposing
to
marry
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
help
her
exact
brutal
vengeance
on
the
mainland
While
he
is
being
baptized
as
the
new
ruler
Yara
and
Theon
realizing
that
he
will
kill
them
immediately
gather
those
loyal
to
them
and
escape
with
the
majority
of
the
Iron
Fleet
Yara
and
Theon
take
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Essos
where
they
stop
over
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
for
rest
and
relaxation
The
Ironborn
frequent
a
brothel
on
the
Long
Bridge
where
they
are
entertained
by
prostitutes
Yara
takes
a
liking
to
one
of
them
and
they
embrace
However
her
brother
Theon
is
still
traumatized
by
his
ordeal
with
Ramsay
and
is
still
guiltridden
over
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
the
orphan
boys
Yara
counsels
her
brother
to
regain
his
former
confidence
over
a
bottle
of
ale
She
tells
him
that
they
plan
to
beat
Euron
in
reaching
Daenerys
first
Yara
plans
to
use
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
to
regain
the
Iron
Islands
and
exact
revenge
against
Euron
As
Theon
finally
regains
some
of
his
swagger
she
leaves
to
have
sex
with
a
prostitute
Yara
and
Daenerys
make
a
pact
In
the
aftermath
of
the
failed
siege
on
Meereen
Yara
and
Theon
arrive
with
their
hundred
ships
seeking
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
newly
victorious
Daenerys
They
offer
the
Mother
of
Dragons
their
fleet
of
ships
in
exchange
for
her
support
of
Yaras
claim
as
the
rightful
Queen
of
the
Iron
Islands
against
Eurons
claim
Tyrion
is
wary
of
Theon
given
what
he
saw
of
him
at
Winterfell
and
his
crimes
against
the
Starks
however
Theon
and
Yara
insist
that
he
has
paid
for
what
he
has
done
In
the
end
Daenerys
Tyrion
Yara
and
Theon
find
common
ground
in
their
hatred
of
their
cruel
and
merciless
fathers
and
their
desire
for
a
better
world
Yara
manages
to
convince
Daenerys
not
to
trust
Euron
Daenerys
finds
Yaras
terms
reasonable
particularly
since
Yaras
offer
of
alliance
is
far
less
matrimonial
and
accepts
the
aid
of
her
one
hundred
ships
although
with
the
condition
that
the
ironborn
stop
their
raping
and
piracy
of
the
mainland
which
Yara
reluctantly
accepts
Some
time
later
Yara
and
Theon
begin
the
voyage
back
to
Westeros
with
the
Iron
Fleet
forming
part
of
Daenerys
Targaryens

Season
Upon
arriving
on

with
Daenerys
Yara
urges
that
they
have
should
immediately
attack
Kings
Landing
due
to
their
vast
armada
and
Daeneryss
dragons
resulting
in
the
capture
of
Kings
Landing
within
a
day
However
Tyrion
doesnt
want
civilians
to
die
in
the
firestorm
and
decided
on
using
Westerosi
armies
to
attack
Kings
Landing
The
plan
shows
that
Yara
will
take
Ellaria
Sand
to
Dorne
where
she
will
ready
her
army
which
will
then
be
ferried
up
to
Kings
Landing
again
by

flirt
Theon
then
tries
to
leave
the
awkward
situation
but
Ellaria
asks
for
more
ale
to
which
Yara
replies
he
is
not
a
servant
and
will
become
her
adviser
and
protector
Ellaria
then
begins
to
get
physical
with
Yara
and
they
begin
kissing
However
a
large
force
rocks
the
ship
Yara
tells
Ellaria
to
stay
below
decks
whilst
she
and
Theon
continue
to
the
bow
Seeing
her
fleet
peppered
by

throat
Calling
over
to
Theon
whom
he
calls
a
cockless
coward
Euron
challenges
his
nephew
to
try
and
save
Yara
However
Theon
looks
around
and
gets
a
harsh
reminder
of
his
torture
by
Ramsay
Bolton
as
he
sees
Eurons
men
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
his
defeated
comrades
Realizing
he
may
suffer
the
same
with
Euron
and
still
mentally
unstable
from
his
past
Yara
is
abandoned
by
Theon
after
he
jumps
off
the
Black
Wind
With
Euron
laughing
in
her
face
and
having
lost
all
respect
for

the

Personality
Yara
Greyjoy
is
an
ironborn
woman
of
the
finest
caliber
courageous
clever
determined
and
proud
In
sharp
contrast
to
the
allusions
people
have
about
her
on
the
basis
that
she
is
a
woman
Yara
is
extremely
headstrong
and
formidable
towards
anybody
who
dares
cross
her
as
well
as
possessing
a
sharp
cynical
and
sarcastic
sense
of

rebuffs
Theons
labeling
her
as
a
woman
by
pointing
out
that
he
is
the
one
wearing
a
skirt
knowing
full
well
that
he
has
already
been
berated
for
it
and
it
will
only
enrage
him
She
is
a
fierce
warrior
and
a
staunch
leader
and
obdurate
about
her
own
independence
She
does
not
apologize
to
her
father
for
leading
a
personal
mission
to
rescue
Theon
from
the
Boltons
despite
having
failed
and
lost
many
men
Because
of
her
sharpness
Yara
can
come
across
as
aggressive
towards
people
she
doesnt
like
or
people
who
try
to
put
her
in
her
place
and
isnt
swayed
when
Theon
warns
her
against
crossing
him
She
can
be
slightly
judgmental
and
labels
Theon
as
an
idiot
for
forgetting
that
while
he
had
conquered
Winterfell
the
ironborn
were
sailors
and
islanders
and
couldnt
hold
Winterfell
for
very
long
Nevertheless
she
clearly
loves
Theon
enough
to
want
to
rescue
him
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
the
time
Theon
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
after
Eddard
Starks
death
Yara
is
a
renowned
leader
and
in
Balons
words
has
commanded
and
killed
men
with
her
own
hands
Despite
their
troubled
past
different
personalities
and
Theons
actions
Yara
still
values
Theons
advice
possibly
from
his
experiences
in
the
North
and
Riverlands
shown
when
she
only
agrees
to
Daenerys
Targaryens
conditions
when
Theon
nods
at
her
and
continues
to
be
protective
of
him
telling
Ellaria
Sand
to
leave
him
alone
when
she
asks
him
to
pour
ale
for
her
and
then
invites
him
for
a
threesome
with
Yara
though
it
can
be
argued
that
Ellaria
did
not
know
that
Theon
had
been
castrated

Ramsay

Behind
the
Scenes
In
an
interview
with
Thronecast
Gemma
Whelan
specified
that
Yara
is
pronounced
yahruh
not
yeahruh
On
the
Season
Bluray
Yara
narrates
Histories
Lore
videos
on
House
Greyjoy
and
The
Drowned
God
After
Season
Yara
only
briefly
appeared
once
in
Season
and
once
in
Season
then
not
at
all
in
Season
before
returning
as
a
major
presence
in
Season
for
the
substantial
Kingsmoot
subplot
from
the
fourth
novel
After
her
return
in
episode
Home
actress
Gemma
Whelan
was
asked
in
interviews
if
she
ever
knew
when
Yara
would
be
returning
for
her
major
subplot
Her
response
was
that
she
never
really
knew
when
the
Greyjoy
storyline
would
return
to
focus
with
the
later
Kingsmoot
subplot
even
by
Seasons
and
the
production
team
felt
lucky
enough
to
get
renewed
one
season
at
a
time
Thus
they
didnt
have
any
firmly
established
plans
about
whether
the
YaraKingsmoot
subplot
would
appear
in
Season
Season
or
not
appear
at
all
though
Whelan
was
made
aware
that
Yara
could
potentially
have
much
more
to
do
several
seasons
into
the
future
but
nothing
was
definitive
She
simply
had
to
hope
along
with
the
audience
that
it
would
eventually
appear
in
the
TV
series
at
some
point
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Yara
is
called
Asha
Greyjoy
but
her
name
was
changed
in
the
TV
series
possibly
to
prevent
confusion
with
Osha
the
wildling
Ironically
as
the
daughter
of
a
Great
House
and
one
of
Balon
Greyjoys
only
two
surviving
children
Asha
Greyjoy
is
actually
a
much
more
prominent
character
than
Osha
the
wildling
Asha
is
even
a
POV
character
in
several
chapters
Thus
it
is
curious
why
they
changed
Ashas
name
and
not
the
other
way
around
It
is
probably
because
Osha
was
already
introduced
in
Season
and
the
similarity
with
Asha
Greyjoys
name
wasnt
realized
until
production
on
Season
began
In
the
German
dub
of
the
TV
series
however
the
character
is
still
called
Asha
as
in
the
books
Another
small
change
is
that
in
the
books
Asha
Greyjoy
has
short
black
hair
a
lean
build
and
a
sharp
beak
of
a
nose
In
the
TV
series
Yara
Greyjoy
has
brown
hair
Other
than
these
minor
naming
and
cosmetic
differences
Gemma
Whelans
portrayal
is
actually
quite
faithful
to
Asha
Greyjoys
behavior
and
actions
in
the
books
Balon
is
greatly
proud
of
his
wild
headstrong
daughter
and
believes
she
can
succeed
him
although
it
is
doubtful
the
other
ironborn
would
accept
her
as
their
queen
He
wishes
Theon
dead
so
he
would
not
stand
in
Ashas
way
though
this
resentment
has
been
cut
from
the
television
series
where
Balon
appears
to
be
genuinely
saddened
after
losing
Theon
to
the
Starks
Ashas
uncles
Victarion
Greyjoy
Aeron
Greyjoy
and
Rodrik
the
Reader
Harlaw
respect
her
and
acknowledge
her
power
but
do
not
believe
she
can
rule
the
ironborn
due
to
her
gender
Other
ironborn
often
mock
Asha
ribaldy
However
Asha
is
confident
and
strongwilled
enough
to
dismiss
such
attitude
scornfully
and
she
always
talks
back
sharply
and
makes
fun
of
those
who
taunt
her
Ashas
crew
adore
her
devotedly
Half
of
them
love
her
as
their
daughter
the
other
half
want
to
have
sex
with
her
and
all
of
them
would
die
for
her
Some
time
after
Winterfell
was
sacked
Asha
comes
there
but
finds
only
unrecognizable
dead
bodies
partly
eaten
by
wolves
She
believes
Theon
is
dead
but
admits
she
cannot
be
certain
She
not
Balon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
with
a
piece
of
Theons
skin
That
makes
her
realize
what
has
become
of
her
brother
but
unlike
in
the
show
she
never
attempts
to
save
him
from
the
Dreadfort
Asha
loves
her
father
but
considers
him
as
a
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord
She
realizes
that
the
ironborn
have
gained
nothing
from
his
military
campaigns
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
and
the
invasion
to
the
north
only
casualties
She
believes
it
would
be
best
for
the
ironborn
to
make
peace
with
the
north
and
this
is
her
main
platform
at
the
kingsmoot
Asha
becomes
a
POV
narrator
starting
in
the
fourth
novel
A
Feast
for
Crows
This
storyline
was
pushed
back
so
it
corresponds
to
TVYara
starting
in
Season
Season
Six
incorporates
the
Asha
storyline
from
the
novel
but
changes
some
of
the
order
of
events
In
A
Feast
of
Crows
Balon
is
dead
by
the
time
that
Yara
returns
to
the
Iron
Islands
Instead
of
visiting
Pyke
she
visits
her
uncle
Rodrik
Harlaw
in
the
Ten
Towers
Despite
these
differences
the
TV
series
still
incorporates
Ashas
character
including
her
intention
to
succeed
her
father
as
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
and
her
criticism
of
Balons
war
strategy
in
the
North
The
death
of
Balon
is
first
reported
as
an
offscreen
event
in
A
Storm
of
Swords
and
Asha
is
not
present
at
his
funeral
Ashas
reunion
with
Theon
occurs
under
very
different
circumstances
in
the
fifth
novel
A
Dance
of
Dragons
Asha
who
by
this
stage
has
been
taken
prisoner
by
King
Stannis
Baratheon
encounters
a
dishevelled
and
battered
Theon
who
had
recently
rescued
the
false
Arya
Stark
actually
Jeyne
Poole
from
Ramsay
Bolton
By
that
stage
the
Kingsmoot
has
already
occurred
with
Asha
and
her
followers
fleeing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
in
the
wake
of
Eurons
victory
In
the
novels
Asha
initially
does
not
recognize
Theon
in
her
eyes
he
is
an
old
man
resembling
a
scarecrow
his
face
is
a
skull
with
skin
his
hair
bonewhite
and
filthy
a
reversal
of
their
first
reunion
on
Pyke
in
A
Clash
of
Kings
When
Stannis
intends
to
execute
Theon
for
his
role
in
the
alleged
murders
of
Bran
and
Rickon
she
pleads
for
his
life
When
that
fails
she
petitions
Stannis
to
execute
him
with
the
sword
to
spare
him
a
painful
death
by
burning
While
the
Kingsmoot
in
A
Feast
of
Crows
also
results
in
Eurons
victory
it
takes
place
under
different
circumstances
from
the
TV
series
Firstly
the
Kingsmoot
takes
place
on
Old
Wyk
rather
than
Pyke
Instead
of
a
two
horse
race
between
Yara
and
Euron
her
book
counterpart
Asha
has
to
face
several
candidates
including
her
other
uncle
Victarion
Greyjoy
Asha
manages
to
humiliate
one
of
her
opponents
Erik
Ironmaker
by
daring
him
to
stand
on
his
two
feet
Eriks
support
evaporates
when
he
is
unable
to
rise
Unlike
the
TV
series
Asha
campaigns
on
a
peace
platform
castigating
Balons
war
and
advocating
making
peace
with
the
North
in
return
for
some
lands
In
the
novel
the
Kingsmoot
almost
ends
in
a
fight
between
Asha
and
Victarions
supporters
until
Euron
manages
to
win
the
Ironborn
over
by
having
one
of
man
blow
an
enchanted
horn
the
Dragonbinder
Following
Eurons
victory
Asha
and
her
supporters
travel
overland
through
Great
Wyk
before
sailing
back
to
Deepwood
Motte
Euron
doesnt
openly
say
that
he
wants
to
kill
Theon
and
Asha
as
he
did
in
the
TV
series
everyone
thinks
Theon
is
dead
at
the
time
and
he
thinks
of
a
more
politically
correct
tactic
to
sideline
her
Euron
cleverly
marries
Asha
in
absentia
to
the
elderly
Erik
Ironmaker
one
of
the
other
lords
at
the
Kingsmoot
so
if
she
returns
to
the
isles
she
can
be
taken
prisoner
and
removed
as
a
threat
At
Deepwood
Motte
Asha
considers
her
options
go
to
Torrhens
Square
which
is
still
held
by
Dagmer
make
new
life
as
a
trader
settle
at
Sea
Dragon
Pointreturn
to
the
Iron
Islands
and
try
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
newcrowned
king
She
soon
receives
a
taunting
letter
from
Ramsay
Bolton
revealing
that
Theon
is
actually
still
alive
and
being
tortured
in
his
dungeon
she
feels
sorry
for
her
brother
but
does
not
intend
to
rescue
him
On
learning
of
this
Tristifer
Botley
who
wishes
to
marry
Asha
explains
to
her
the
history
of
Torgon
the
Latecomer
that
a
Kingsmoot
can
be
declared
invalid
by
the
priests
if
one
of
the
prior
kings
lawful
sons
was
not
present
to
put
forward
his
candidacy
The
story
gives
Asha
an
idea
Theon
probably
wouldnt
win
an
election
even
if
they
manage
to
rescue
him
but
Asha
realizes
that
his
mere
survival
would
give
a
pretext
for
the
Drowned
Men
to
invalidate
Eurons
election
and
call
for
a
new
Kingsmoot
Given
that
the
Drowned
Men
hate
Euron
as
an
ungodly
man
they
would
probably
agree
to
this
and
several
of
the
major
lords
who
voted
for
Euron
are
starting
to
grow
uneasy
at
his
dark
behavior
theres
a
good
chance
Asha
could
hold
and
win
a
new
Kingsmoot
if
she
manages
to
recover
Theon
Before
Asha
can
start
acting
on
this
nascent
plan
however
Stannis
Baratheon
attacks
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Deepwood
Motte
Nearly
all
Ashas
remaining
forces
are
slaughtered
and
she
herself
is
taken
prisoner
The
march
of
Stanniss
host
to
Winterfell
is
narrated
from
her
POV
After
travelling
more
than
a
month
in
Stanniss
camp
Asha
is
reunited
with
none
other
than
Theon
who
was
capturedrescued
by
loyalist
Northern
forces
led
by
Mors
Umber
outside
of
Winterfell
after
jumping
off
the
castle
walls
along
with
Jeyne
Poole
under
cover
from
a
blizzard
Theons
torture
at
Ramsays
hands
has
been
so
severe
that
he
is
unrecognizable
to
her
at
first
looking
like
a
starved
toothless
old
man
and
with
his
hair
having
turned
white
from
the
stress
In
the
sample
chapter
of
the
sixth
book
Theon
overhears
Ser
Justin
Massey
requesting
permission
from
Stannis
to
marry
Asha
reasoning
that
one
day
Stannis
will
need
to
take
the
Iron
Islandsand
that
will
go
much
easier
with
Balon
Greyjoys
daughter
as
a
catspaw
with
one
of
his
own
leal
men
as
her
lord
husband
Ser
Justin
claims
the
fact
that
Asha
is
currently
married
is
not
a
problem
her
marriage
was
done
with
a
proxy
and
was
never
consummated
and
therefore
can
be
annulled
besides
Erik
Ironmaker
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
Stannis
thinks
it
over
and
answers
Serve
me
well
in
this
matter
of
the
sellswords
and
you
may
have
what
you
desireUntil
such
time
the
woman
must
needs
remain
my
captive
Asha
and
Theon
do
not
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
in
the
current
novels
the
TV
show
gave
them
this
subplot
as
a
condensation
with
the
storyline
of
their
other
uncle
Victarion
who
was
cut
from
the
TV
series
Euron
actually
sends
Victarion
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
Meereen
to
court
Daenerys
as
Eurons
new
bride
but
Victarion
secretly
plans
to
betray
his
hated
brother
and
marry
Daenerys
himself
then
use
the
Iron
Fleet
and
her
dragons
to
retake
the
isles
The
TV
version
condensed
this
so
that
Yara
and
Theon
flee
with
the
Iron
Fleet
to
seek
Daeneryss
help
but
openly
plan
to
return
to
overthrow
Euron
It
is
asyet
unknown
if
Asha
and
Theon
in
the
books
might
also
try
to
ally
with
Daenerys
in
the
next
novel
this
is
assuming
they
somehow
manage
to
escape
both
Stanniss
camp
and
the
Bolton
army
There
might
also
be
a
second
Kingsmoot
in
the
novels
to
which
Asha
hopes
to
bring
Theon
to
endorse
her
candidacy
if
so
the
TV
show
condensed
this
into
a
single
event
AshaYaras

in
Volantis
in
this
episode
Martin
directly
stated
that
Yaras
character
in
the
books
actually
isnt
bisexual
though
several
other
characters
had
bisexual
experiences
which
were
cut
from
the
TV
show
The
Season
episode
The
Broken
Man
depicts
Yara
Greyjoy
kissing
and
fondling
a
female
prostitute
in
Volantis
and
at
the
end
of
the
scene
she
openly
says
shes
going
to
have
sex
with
the
prostitute
Asha
Greyjoy
in
the
books
shows
no
particular
hints
of
being
interested
in
women
she
is
very
sexually
active
and
unashamed
of
this
going
so
far
as
to
learn
from
a
woods
witch
how
to
make
her
own
moon
tea
a
contraceptive
and
abortive
drug
She
has
had
numerous
relationships
long
and
short
over
the
course
of
her
adult
life
This
is
considered
very
atypical
behavior
for
a
highborn
woman
much
less
an
ironborn
woman
but
Balon
raised
her
as
essentially
a
surrogate
son
so
she
doesnt
strive
towards
ladylike
behavior
In
the
books
she
even
cuts
her
hair
short
like
a
boys
though
artistic
depictions
of
what
exactly
short
means
can
vary
and
might
mean
nearly
shoulder
length
given
that
men
in
the
medieval
setting
also
wear
their
hair
fairly
long
When
Theon
first
encounters
Asha
again
in
the
second
novel
he
notes
that
only
a
few
ironborn
women
ever
take
part
in
sailing
on
their
longships
but
it
is
said
of
those
who
do
that
the
salt
and
sea
change
them
giving
them
a
mans
appetites
however
in
this
context
Theons
POV
narration
specifically
referred
to
how
sexually
forward
she
was
being
with
him
a
man
as
part
of
her
prank
not
telling
him
she
was
his
sister
that
he
hadnt
seen
in
years
Asha
has
been
very
sexually
active
with
men
and
had
many
lovers
some
for
half
a
year
many
for
just
half
a
night
One
of
the
more
notable
ones
is
her
lovesick
champion
Tristifer
Botley
whom
she
broke
up
with
as
a
teenager
but
who
nonetheless
remains
loyal
to
Asha
and
continues
to
pine
for
her
She
later
lost
her
virtue
when
she
was
years
old
to
a
sailor
from
Lys
Recently
she
has
been
having
a
casual
affair
with
one
of
her
other
champions
Qarl
the
Maid
but
it
isnt
a
serious
relationship
Game
of
Thrones
Wiki
reached
out
to
George
RR
Martin
himself
to
inquire
about
this
and
he
responded
Question
Is
Asha
Greyjoy
renamed
Yara
in
the
TV
series
bisexual
in
the
books
or
it
was
implied
and
we
just
didnt
catch
on
to
it
GRRM
I
have
a
number
of
lesbian
and
bisexual
women
in
the
novels
and
a
couple
who
experiment
but
Asha
is
not
one
of
them
Unless
I
am
forgetting
something
Martin
therefore
confirmed
that
Asha
in
the
books
is
not
bisexual
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
is
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
for
Yara
to
be
attracted
to
women
As
for
Daenerys
apparently
being
receptive
to
Yaras
flirtatious
dialogue
in
the
Season
finale
this
is
actually
not
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
as
Daenerys
is
bisexual
in
the
novels
or
at
least
experimenting
In
a
postSeason
interviews
with
the
actress
Gemma
Whelan
shared
how
she
thought
Yara
Greyjoy
in
the
TV
series
is
pansexual
the
term
she
uses
attracted
to
both
men
and
women
Explicitly
asked
in
an
interview
with
Vulture
if
Yara
is
lesbian
or
bisexual
she
said
she
thought
Yara
had
sex
with
both
men
and
women
and
that
the
term
pansexual
would
probably
be
more
accurate
not
bisexual
Subsequently
Season
s
Stormborn
confirmed
in
dialogue
that
Yara
is
what
would
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
pansexual
when
asked
if
she
has
a
boy
in
every
new
port
she
docks
at
Yara
says
she
has
boys
and
girls
it
depends
on
the
port
In
reallife
the
historical
Vikings
themselves
actually
had
a
TopBottom
dichotomy
model
of
sexuality
which
didnt
really
recognize
sexual
categories
for
women
thus
Viking
women
were
in
effect
pansexual
to
apply
a
modern
term
not
even
recognizing
categories
Therefore
it
is
quite
fitting
that
while
an
invention
of
the
TV
series
TVYara
similarly
doesnt
limit
her
sexuality
to
specific
categories
as
real
Viking
women
didnt
either
While
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
stated
to
consider
female
homosexuality
to
be
a
sin
like
male
homosexuality
the
Iron
Islands
follow
the
Drowned
God
religion
and
its
attitudes
towards
male
or
female
homosexuality
actually
havent
been
mentioned
in
the
novels
Thus
it
isnt
necessarily
contradicting
anything
from
ironborn
culture
in
the
novels
if
Yara
is
openly
having
sex
with
women
but
none
of
her
companions
or
the
Drowned
Men
remark
on
it
as
unusual
in
contrast
if
Cersei
was
openly
taking
female
lovers
at
the
royal
court
in
Kings
Landing
in
the
books
she
has
one
Lady
Taena
Merryweather
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
would
publicly
condemn
her
for
it
Reaction
to
this
change
in
AshaYaras
sexuality
generally
received
a
positive
reception
from
critics
WatchersOnTheWallcoms
Sue
the
Fury
said
Im
stoked
for
the
show
to
have
Yara
be
interested
in
women
Its
not
important
to
the
plot
but
I
appreciate
it
AfterEllencoms
Chelsea
Steiner
wrote
a
separate
oped
article
on
the
development
and
said
she
was
happy
that
TVYara
is
presented
as
a
queer
female
in
the
TV
show
that
is
a
woman
of
agency
and
major
protagonist
in
Season
instead
of
just
one
of
the
background
prostitutes
having
sex
with
other
women
as
in
past
seasons
Yara
is
actually
not
the
first
queer
female
character
to
appear
in
the
TV
series
even
discounting
minor
female
prostitutes
who
appear
in
the
background
of
scenes
or
put
on
performances
for
men
as
Ros
and
Daisy
did
in
Season
The
first
queer
female
character
to
be
introduced
in
the
TV
series
was
Ellaria
Sand
whose
first
scenes
in
Season
involved
her
picking
out
a
female
prostitute
to
have
sex
with
along
with
her
male
lover
Oberyn
who
was
also
bisexual
several
episodes
later
Ellaria
was
shown
onscreen
receiving
oral
sex
from
the
female
prostitute
Marei
Ellaria
and
Oberyn
were
described
as
bisexualpansexual
in
the
novels
though
the
books
didnt
outright
depict
them
in
sex
scenes

A
walk
of
atonement
is
a
public
ritual
of
punishment
and
penance
in
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
It
demands
a
confessed
sinner
to
walk
a
certain
distance
stripped
of
all
clothing
exposed
to
the
eyes
and
jeers
of
the

History
Season
Cersei
prepares
for
her
Walk
of
atonement
After
being
caught
at
a
brothel
in
the
middle
of
a
session
of
blasphemous
sexual
roleplay
the
High
Septon
is
trapped
by
a
group
of
Sparrows
stripped
of
all
his
clothes
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
while
one
of
the
Sparrows
publicly
names
him
a
sinner
and
beats
his
hands
to
keep
him
from
covering
his
genitalia
Cersei
endures
her
punishment
After
a
time
imprisoned
by
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
Queen
Cersei
confesses
to
having
committed
adultery
with
her
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
who
had
joined
the
Faith
Militant
and
accused
her
of
fornication
regicide
and
incest
The
High
Sparrow
informs
Cersei
that
she
will
still
be
tried
for
the
other
two
charges
that
she
denies
while
allowing
her
to
return
to
the
Red
Keep
only
if
she
performs
a
walk
of
atonement
as
penance
for
her
confessed
sin
Cerseis
hair
is
cut
short
and
then
she
is
presented
to
the
population
of
Kings
Landing
so
they
will
bear
witness
to
her
confession
and
penitence
She
is
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
made
to
walk
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
to
the
Red
Keep
escorted
by
members
of
the
Faith
Militant
who
keep
away
the
leering
and
jeering
crowds
who
have
gathered
to
see
her
shame
and
take
the
chance
to
insult
their
hated
Queen
Mother
As
she
walks
Septa
Unella
accompanies
her
crying
out
Shame
repeatedly
while
ringing
a
bell
to
attract
peoples
attention
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
it
seems
walks
of
atonement
are
civil
punishments
reserved
to
publicly
shame
women
accused
of
adultery
or
whoring
It
also
serves
as
a
means
of
degrading
these
woman
and
stripping
them
of
whatever
pride
or
power
they
might
hold
The
novels
mention
only
two
people
who
had
to
go
through
this
humiliating
punishment
Tytos
Lannisters
mistress
and
Cersei
Tywin
Lannister
forced
his
fathers
mistress
into
a
walk
of
atonement
after
Lord
Tytos
died
While
it
is
common
for
widowed
lords
to
take
lowborn
women
as
bedwarmers
Tytoss
mistress
a
woman
scarcely
one
step
above
a
whore
had
come
to
dominate
him
utterly
being
seated
beside
him
in
the
hall
showered
with
gifts
and
honors
even
being
asked
her
views
on
matters
of
state
She
came
to
steal
from
him
order
the
household
knights
about
dismiss
servants
and
help
herself
to
the
jewelry
of
the
late
Lady
Jeyne
Tytoss
wife
She
grew
so
influential
that
it
was
said
about
Lannisport
that
any
man
who
wished
for
his
petition
to
be
heard
should
kneel
before
her
and
speak
loudly
to
her
lap
for
Lord
Tytoss
ear
was
between
his
ladys
legs
Lord
Tytos
died
of
a
heart
attack
while
climbing
stairs
to
see
her
The
first
thing
Tywin
did
on
his
return
from
Kings
Landing
was
to
expel
the
mistress
from
Casterly
Rock
All
the
selfseekers
who
had
named
themselves
her
friends
and
cultivated
her
favor
abandoned
her
The
silks
and
velvets
Tytos
had
lavished
on
her
and
the
jewelry
she
had
taken
for
herself
was
stripped
from
her
Tywin
had
her
stripped
and
sent
forth
naked
to
walk
through
the
streets
of
Lannisport
to
the
docks
for
a
fortnight
telling
everyone
she
met
in
the
way
she
was
a
thief
and
a
whore
Though
no
man
laid
a
hand
on
her
that
walk
spelled
the
end
of
her
power
Cersei
was
too
young
to
witness
the
spectacle
herself
but
heard
the
stories
from
washerwomen
and
guardsmen
who
had
been
there
Although
Kevan
has
disapproved
with
Cerseis
deeds
especially
her
incestuous
affair
with
Jaime
corrupting
Lancel
spoiling
Joffrey
and
her
poor
conduct
as
the
Queen
Regent
he
does
not
gloat
at
Cersei
but
feels
sorry
for
her
public
humiliation
He
muses
sadly
that
his
brother
never
dreamed
that
the
same
degrading
punishment
he
gave
his
fathers
mistress
would
be
imposed
on
his
own
daughter
In
the
novels
when
Cersei
is
shorn
the
septas
remove
all
of
her
body
hair
her
eyebrows
pubic
hair
even
scraping
the
rest
of
her
body
They
shave
her
head
completely
bald
In
the
TV
episode
the
septas
prominently
produce
a
razor
blade
as
if
they
are
going
to
shave
her
but
then
curiously
do
not
use
it
at
all
One
septa
separately
picks
up
a
pair
of
shears
and
cuts
her
luxurious
long
golden
hair
off
but
crops
it
close
to
her
head
instead
of
shaving
her
bald
entirely
In
her
subsequent
nude
scenes
the
rest
of
her
body
hair
isnt
shaved
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
Cerseis
walk
of
atonement
is
loosely
based
on
what
happened
to
Jane
Shore
the
mistress
of
King
Edward
IV
of
England
who
like
Robert
Baratheon
was
a
great
warrior
who
won
the
crown
on
the
battlefield
in
his
youth
but
became
fat
and
illsuited
to
rule
in
later
life
After
Edward
IV
died
his
brother
Richard
III
usurped
the
throne
ahead
of
his
nephews
He
deeply
resented
Jane
so
he
had
her
arrested
and
made
her
perform
a
penance
walk
a
common
punishment
for
harlotry
Jane
Shore
did
not
perform
the
penance
walk
naked
however
but
had
to
walk
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
London
wearing
only
her
kirtle
petticoat
which
given
the
times
was
still
said
to
have
gained
significant
male
attention
the
main
source
of
the
humiliation
was
that
this
was
a
punishment
normally
meted
out
to
harlots
Martin
has
said
that
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
one
of
the
major
inspirations
for
his
novels
the
conflict
was
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
while
in
Westeros
the
conflict
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
clearly
named
after
the
real
families

Aegon
IV
is
remembered
as
one
of
the
worst
kings
in
the
entire
history
of
the
Targaryen
dynasty
which
is
the
reason
why
he
is
popularly
known
as
Aegon
the
Unworthy
Aegon
was
a
decadent
gluttonous
and
corrupt
ruler
who
indulged
his
passions
and
whims
at
every
opportunity
Being
attractive
in
his
youth
he
was
popular
with
women
both
highborn
and
lowborn
He
had
as
many
as
nine
mistresses
and
many
bastards
Supposedly
he
had
any
woman
he
wanted
whether
they
were
married
or
not
People
often
joked
that
while
the
Targaryen
words
were
Fire
and
Blood
Aegon
IVs
motto
might
as
well
have
been
Wash
her
and
bring
her
to
my
bed
Due
to
his
years
of
overindulgence
by
the
end
of
his
reign
Aegon
IV
was
extremely
obese
to
the
point
that
his
legs
could
barely
support
his
own
weight
Even
so
he
remained
quite
vain
throughout
his
life
Moreover
he
was
a
very
petty
man
needlessly
causing
strife
at
the
royal
court
Four
of
his
bastard
children
were
born
to
noblewomen
and
they
became
known
as
the
Great
Bastards
Chief
among
them
was
Daemon
who
upon
being
legitimized
created
House
Blackfyre
Other
notable
bastards
were
AegorRivers
BittersteelBryndenRivers
Bloodraven
and
Shiera
SeastarAegon
IV
foolishly
legitimized
all
of
his
bastard
children
upon
his
deathbed
which
resulted
in
Daemon
Blackfyre
declaring
himself
the
rightful
heir
and
tearing
apart
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
civil
war
Ultimately
Aegon
IVs
corruption
led
to
a
series
of
Blackfyre
Rebellions
which
would
plague
Westeros
for
five
generations
According
to
author
George
RR
Martin
Aegon
IV
is
loosely
the
Targaryen
equivalent
of
King
Henry
VIII
of
England
Martins
instructions
for
artistic
depictions
of
Aegon
IV
explicitly
cite
Henry
VIII
Both
kings
started
out
young
and
attractive
but
by
the
ends
of
their
reigns
became
infamously
fat
from
overindulgence
and
their
numerous
sexual
affairs
resulted
in
bloody
succession
conflicts
which
were
eventually
resolved
with
the
rise
of
good
rulers
Daeron
II
and
Elizabeth
I
respectively

A

camp
Giants
are
a
nonhuman
race
considered
to
be
legendary
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
south
of
the
Wall
However
giants
do
actually
exist
in

north
Beyond
the
Wall
This
is
in
contrast
with
both
the
Children
of

History
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
While
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do

Wall
Season
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten
Season
A
giant
in
the
Free
Folk
camp
in
Skirling
Pass
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
there
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
tells
him
how
a
giant
once
smashed
a
man
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
Gallery
The
Free
Folk
believe
giants
were
enslaved
with
magic
to
get
them
to
build
the
Wall

Behind
the
scenes
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
themm
from
the
wildling
humans
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
The
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Giants
are
generally
not
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speach
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
and
ride
into
battle
on
the
back
of
mammoths
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology

extinct

Season
A
giant
in
the
Free
Folk
camp
in
Skirling
Pass
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
there
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
tells
him
how
a
giant
once
smashed
a
man
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
Gallery
The
Free
Folk
believe
giants
were
enslaved
with
magic
to
get
them
to
build
the
Wall

Behind

scenes
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
themm
from
the
wildling
humans
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
more
apelike
appearance
They
wear
no
clothing
instead
they
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
like
mammoths
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
The
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
They
also
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
and
ride
into
battle
on
the
back
of
mammoths
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before

HistoryEdit
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
Edit
While
visiting
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Edit
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten

Dongo
working
at
wildling
camp
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
their
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
told
him
how
she
once
saw
a
giant
smash
a
man
straight
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
Season
Edit
Following
Jon
Snows
betrayal
and
flight
from
the
wildlings
he
reports
back
to
Castle
Blacks
remaining
leadership
that
Mance
Rayder
is
advancing
on
their
position
with
an
army
strong
and
that
he
has
united
the
Thenns
Hornfoots
and
the
Iceriver
clans
and
he
even
has
giants
marching
with
him
Janos
Slynt
breaks
out
laughing
as
south
of
the
Wall
giants
are
just
a
creature
from
stories
to
frighten
children
but
he
stops
when
he
sees
that
the
other
Nights
Watch
officers
such
as
Alliser
Thorne
and
Maester
Aemon
arent
laughing
but
are
apparently
willing
to
give
some
credence
to
Jon
if
he
says
he
saw
giants
with
his
own
eyes
During
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
several
giants
go
into
battle
against
the
Nights
Watch
along
with
the
Free
Folk
They
shoot
large
arrows
at
the
watchers
on
top
of
the
Wall
and
use
a
mammoth
to
try
and
break
down
the
Outer
Gate
One
of
them
Mag

Tun
Doh
Weg
manages
to
get
into
the
tunnel
leading
to
Castle
Black
but
is
killed
by
a
group
of
black
brothers
led
by
Grenn
As
the
night
ends
with
the
wildlings
momentarily
retreating
Jon
remarks
to
Samwell
Tarly
that
among
the
army
of
nearly
wildlings
that
Mance
has
amassed
there
might
be
hundreds
of
Giants
Season
Edit
At
Hardhome
Wun
Weg
Wun
Dar
Wun
is
the
only
known
giant
residing
in
the
wildling
settlement
Inside
the
large
keep
he
was
seen
looking
at
the
dragonglass
dagger
and
later
got
annoyed
when
Dolorous
Edd
stares
at
him
for
too
long
When
a
horde
of
wights
and
White
Walkers
under
theNight
King
attack
Wun
Wun
joined
in
the
defense
as
he
easily
defeats
many
wights
before
covering
the
escape
of
Jon
Snow
Tormund
and
the
few
remaining
defenders
with
a
burning
log
from
the
overwhelming
enemy
as
he
walks
into
the
sea
with
them
and
the
fleet
of
ships
boarded
by
wildling
refugees
Arriving
at
the
Wall
Wun
Wun
and
the
few
thousand
wildlings
were
allowed
safe
passage
to
settle
in
the
Gift
although
the
black
brothers
of
the
Nights
Watch
were
intimidated
at
the
sight
of
Wun
Wun
as
they
have
never
seen
a
giant
before
Season
Edit
When
Jon
Snow
is
later
assassinated
Wun
Wun
and
the
wildlings
are
summoned
back
to
Castle
Black
to
deal
with
the
mutineers
Wun
Wun
breaks
down
the
gate
at
Castle
Black
and
easily
intimidates
them
into
surrendering
killing
only
one
mutineer
after
he
foolishly
and
futilely
shot
the
giant
in
the
back
with
a
crossbow
He
later
agrees
to
help
a
resurrected
Jon
Snow
in
his
forthcoming
battle
against
Ramsay
Bolton
Wun
Wun
participates
in
the
battle
and
is
inundated
with
dozens
of
arrows
and
pierced
by
spears
He
falls
to
his
knees
before
being
shot
in
the
eye
by
Ramsay
after
breaching
Winterfell
It
is
unknown
whether
there
are
even
a
few
remaining
living
Giants
left
beyond
the
Wall
as
the
White
Walkers
are
seemingly
destroying
every
last
Free
Folk
stronghold
so
it
is
possible
that
with
Wun
Wuns
death
the
Giants
are
completely
extinct
Season
Edit
Surrounded
by
a
snowstorm
undead
giants
are
seen
within
the
massive
army
of
wights
being
led
by
White
Walkers
In
the
season
finale
two
large
wight
giants
are
seen
within
the
massive
army
of
undead
wights
Once
the
wall
has
been
breached
they
began
to
march
in
with
the
rest
of
the

Behind
the
scenesEdit
The
giant
costumes
are
actually
full
body
foam
suits
which
have
to
be
assembled
around
the
actors
By
the
end
of
Season
only
two
of
these
expensive
suits
have
been
produced
for
the
giants
Dongo
who
first
appeared
in
Season
played
by
Ian
Whyte
and
Mag
the
Mighty
played
by
Neil
Fingleton
Taller
people
and
creatures
physically
walk
with
a
different
gait
and
heft
than
smaller
ones
due
to
the
mechanics
of
their
extra
weight
simply
using
CGI
greenscreen
effects
to
make
an
averagesized
stuntman
appear
feet
tall
doesnt
realistically
capture
the
mechanics
of
how
a
giant
person
would
actually
move
The
TV
series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is
filmed
at
frames
per
second
but
giants
are
filmed
at
frames
per
second
after
which
the
footage
is
played
back
at
the
regular
frames
per
second
making
them
appear
slightly
slower
The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are
even
larger
Other
techniques
were
that
the
giants
head
prosthetics
are
much
larger
than
the
actors
actual
heads
underneath
even
the
giants
hands
seen
onscreen
are
actually
oversized
gloves
that
fit
over
the
already
very
large
stuntmens
hands
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humans

Creating
the
Mammoths
and
Giants
Joe
Bauer
VFX
Supervisor
The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for
each
of
our
giants
In
the
booksEdit
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
considered
to
be
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans
or
warband
leaders
A
particularly
large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent
ringleader
of
the
giants
in
Mance
Rayders
army
The
giants
inhabit
the
far
northern
regions
of
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
where
humans
will
not
encroach
on
them
perilously
close
to
the
Lands
of
Always
Winter
They
once
roamed
all
of
Westeros
but
were
pushed
further
and
further
north
when
the
First
Men
migrated
to
the
continent
starting
twelve
thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who

Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence

because
they
do
not
match

he

This

author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

Giants
are
a
nonhuman
race
considered
to
be
legendary
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
south
of
the
Wall
However
giants
do
actually
exist
in
the
furthest
north
Beyond
the
Wall
This
is
in
contrast
with
both
the
Children
of

and
the

History
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
While
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten
Season
A
giant
in
the
Free
Folk
camp
in
Skirling
Pass
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
their
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
told
him
how
she
once
saw
a
giant
smash
a
man
straight
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail

The
Free
Folk
believe
giants
were
enslaved
with
magic
to
get
them
to
build

Behind
the
scenes
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humans
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans
or
warband
leaders
A
particularly
large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent
ringleader
of
the
giants
in
Mance
Rayders
army
The
giants
inhabit
the
far
northern
regions
of
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
where
humans
will
not
encroach
on
them
perilously
close
to
the
Lands
of
Always
Winter
They
once
roamed
all
of
Westeros
but
were
pushed
further
and
further
north
when
the
First
Men
migrated
to
the
continent
starting
twelve
thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

Giants
are
a
nonhuman
race
considered
to
be
legendary
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
south
of
the
Wall
However
giants
do
actually
exist
in
the
furthest
north
Beyond
the
Wall
This
is
in
contrast
with
both
the
Children
of
the
Forest
and
the
White
Walkers
which
even
the
wildlings
claim
to
have
not
seen
in
thousands
of
years
Contentsshow
History
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
While
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten
Season
A
giant
in
the
Free
Folk
camp
in
Skirling
Pass
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
She
tells
him
how
a
giant
once
smashed
a
man
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Giants
have
a
more
apelike
appearance
They
wear
no
clothing
instead
they
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
like
mammoths
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
and
ride
into
battle
in
the
back
of
mammoths
Gallery
The
Free
Folk
believe
giants
were
enslaved
with
magic
to
get
them
to
build
the
Wall

do

The

costumes
are
actually
full
body
foam
suits
which
have
to
be
assembled
around
the
actors
By
the
end
of
Season
only
two
of
these
expensive
suits
have
been
produced
for
the
giants
Dongo
who
first
appeared
in
Season

Ian

and

Mighty
played
by
Neil
Fingleton
Taller
people
and
creatures
physically
walk
with
a
different
gait
and
heft
than
smaller
ones
due
to
the
mechanics
of
their
extra
weight
simply
using
CGI
greenscreen
effects
to
make
an
averagesized
stuntman
appear
feet
tall
doesnt
realistically
capture
the
mechanics
of
how
a
giant
person
would
actually
move
The
TV
series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is
filmed
at
frames
per
second
but
giants
are
filmed
at
frames
per
second
after
which
the
footage
is
played
back
at
the
regular
frames
per
second
making
them
appear
slightly
slower
The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are
even
larger
Other
techniques
were
that
the
giants
head
prosthetics
are
much
larger
than
the
actors
actual
heads
underneath
even
the
giants
hands
seen
onscreen
are
actually
oversized
gloves
that
fit
over
the
already
very
large
stuntmens
hands
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humans

Creating
the
Mammoths
and
Giants
Joe
Bauer
VFX
Supervisor
The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for
each
of
our
giants
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans
or
warband
leaders
A
particularly
large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent
ringleader
of
the
giants
in
Mance
Rayders
army
The
giants
inhabit
the
far
northern
regions
of
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
where
humans
will
not
encroach
on
them
perilously
close
to
the
Lands
of
Always
Winter
They
once
roamed
all
of
Westeros
but
were
pushed
further
and
further
north
when
the
First
Men
migrated
to
the
continent
starting
twelve
thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

Giants
are
a
nonhuman
race
considered
to
be
legendary
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
south
of
the
Wall
However
giants
do
actually
exist
in
the
furthest
north
Beyond
the
Wall
This
is
in
contrast
with
both
the
Children
of
the
Forest
and
the
White
Walkers
which
even
the
wildlings
claim
to
have
not
seen
in
thousands
of
years
Contentsshow
History
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
While
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten
Season
A
giant
in
the
Free
Folk
camp
in
Skirling
Pass
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
She
tells
him
how
a
giant
once
smashed
a
man
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Giants
have
a
more
apelike
appearance
They
wear
no
clothing
instead
they
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
like
mammoths
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
and
ride
into
battle
on
the
back
of
mammoths
Gallery
The
Free
Folk
believe
giants
were
enslaved
with
magic
to
get
them
to
build
the
Wall

The

two
of

with
the
height
added
from
the
full

they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down

movements

The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as

from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from

Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a

the
impression

they

techniques
were
that

much
larger

I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes

Joe

The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for

HistoryEdit
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
Edit
While
visiting
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Edit
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten

Dongo
working
at
wildling
camp
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
their
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
told
him
how
she
once
saw
a
giant
smash
a
man
straight
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
Season
Edit
Following
Jon
Snows
betrayal
and
flight
from
the
wildlings
he
reports
back
to
Castle
Blacks
remaining
leadership
that
Mance
Rayder
is
advancing
on
their
position
with
an
army
strong
and
that
he
has
united
the
Thenns
Hornfoots
and
the
Iceriver
clans
and
he
even
has
giants
marching
with
him
Janos
Slynt
breaks
out
laughing
as
south
of
the
Wall
giants
are
just
a
creature
from
stories
to
frighten
children
but
he
stops
when
he
sees
that
the
other
Nights
Watch
officers
such
as
Alliser
Thorne
and
Maester
Aemon
arent
laughing
but
are
apparently
willing
to
give
some
credence
to
Jon
if
he
says
he
saw
giants
with
his
own
eyes
During
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
several
giants
go
into
battle
against
the
Nights
Watch
along
with
the
Free
Folk
They
shoot
large
arrows
at
the
watchers
on
top
of
the
Wall
and
use
a
mammoth
to
try
and
break
down
the
Outer
Gate
One

manages
to
get
into
the
tunnel
leading
to
Castle
Black
but
is
killed
by
a
group
of
black
brothers
led
by
Grenn
As
the
night
ends
with
the
wildlings
momentarily
retreating
Jon
remarks
to
Samwell
Tarly
that
among
the
army
of
nearly
wildlings
that
Mance
has
amassed
there
might
be
hundreds
of
Giants
Season
Edit
At
Hardhome
Wun
Weg
Wun
Dar
Wun
is
the
only
known
giant
residing
in
the
wildling
settlement
Inside
the
large
keep
he
was
seen
looking
at
the
dragonglass
dagger
and
later
got
annoyed
when
Dolorous
Edd
stares
at
him
for
too
long
When
a
horde
of
wights
and
White
Walkers
under
theNight
King
attack
Wun
Wun
joined
in
the
defense
as
he
easily
defeats
many
wights
before
covering
the
escape
of
Jon
Snow
Tormund
and
the
few
remaining
defenders
with
a
burning
log
from
the
overwhelming
enemy
as
he
walks
into
the
sea
with
them
and
the
fleet
of
ships
boarded
by
wildling
refugees
Arriving
at
the
Wall
Wun
Wun
and
the
few
thousand
wildlings
were
allowed
safe
passage
to
settle
in
the
Gift
although
the
black
brothers
of
the
Nights
Watch
were
intimidated
at
the
sight
of
Wun
Wun
as
they
have
never
seen
a
giant
before
Season
Edit
When
Jon
Snow
is
later
assassinated
Wun
Wun
and
the
wildlings
are
summoned
back
to
Castle
Black
to
deal
with
the
mutineers
Wun
Wun
breaks
down
the
gate
at
Castle
Black
and
easily
intimidates
them
into
surrendering
killing
only
one
mutineer
after
he
foolishly
and
futilely
shot
the
giant
in
the
back
with
a
crossbow
He
later
agrees
to
help
a
resurrected
Jon
Snow
in
his
forthcoming
battle
against
Ramsay
Bolton
Wun
Wun
participates
in
the
battle
and
is
inundated
with
dozens
of
arrows
and
pierced
by
spears
He
falls
to
his
knees
before
being
shot
in
the
eye
by
Ramsay
after
breaching
Winterfell
It
is
unknown
whether
there
are
even
a
few
remaining
living
Giants
left
beyond
the
Wall
as
the
White
Walkers
are
seemingly
destroying
every
last
Free
Folk
stronghold
so
it
is
possible
that
with
Wun
Wuns
death
the
Giants
are
completely
extinct
Season
Edit
Surrounded
by
a
snowstorm
undead
giants
are
seen
within
the
massive
army
of
wights
being

by
White

In
the
season
finale
two
large
wight
giants
are
seen
within
the
massive
army
of
undead
wights
Once
the
wall
has
been
breached
they
began
to
march
in
with
the
rest
of
the

Behind
the
scenesEdit
The
giant
costumes
are
actually
full
body
foam
suits
which
have
to
be
assembled
around
the
actors
By
the
end
of
Season
only
two
of
these
expensive
suits
have
been
produced
for
the
giants
Dongo
who
first
appeared
in
Season
played
by
Ian
Whyte
and
Mag
the
Mighty
played
by
Neil
Fingleton
Taller
people
and
creatures
physically
walk
with
a
different
gait
and
heft
than
smaller
ones
due
to
the
mechanics
of
their
extra
weight
simply
using
CGI
greenscreen
effects
to
make
an
averagesized
stuntman
appear
feet
tall
doesnt
realistically
capture
the
mechanics
of
how
a
giant
person
would
actually
move
The
TV
series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is
filmed
at
frames
per
second
but
giants
are
filmed
at
frames
per
second
after
which
the
footage
is
played
back
at
the
regular
frames
per
second
making
them
appear
slightly
slower
The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are
even
larger
Other
techniques
were
that
the
giants
head
prosthetics
are
much
larger
than
the
actors
actual
heads
underneath
even
the
giants
hands
seen
onscreen
are
actually
oversized
gloves
that
fit
over
the
already
very
large
stuntmens
hands
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humans

Creating
the
Mammoths
and
Giants
Joe
Bauer
VFX
Supervisor
The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for
each
of
our
giants
In
the
booksEdit
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
considered
to
be
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans
or
warband
leaders
A
particularly
large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent
ringleader
of
the
giants
in
Mance
Rayders
army
The
giants
inhabit
the
far
northern
regions
of
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
where
humans
will
not
encroach
on
them
perilously
close
to
the
Lands
of
Always
Winter
They
once
roamed
all
of
Westeros
but
were
pushed
further
and
further
north
when
the
First
Men
migrated
to
the
continent
starting
twelve
thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

and
Tommen
by
announcing
that
he
wishes
to
see
the
Wall
and
the
wintry
abode

He
then
amuses
them
by
claiming
that

wants
to

off

edge
of
the
wall

irritated
by
his

is
pleased
when
her
uncle
Tyrion
Lannister
arrives
during
the
festivities
and
tells
her
that
she
is
more
beautiful
than
ever
When
Joffrey
callously
says
that
they
had
heard
he
was
dead
Myrcella
tells
Tyrion
that
she
is
glad
that
rumors
of
his
death
were
not
true
Myrcella
attends
a
tense
dinner
with
her
younger
brother
Tommen
her
mother
Cersei
and
Sansa
Stark
Myrcella
naively
makes
smalltalk
with
Sansa
asking
when
she
will
marry
Joffrey
and
Cersei
explains
it
will
be
after
the
war
ends
Myrcella
says
that
she
is
excited
for
the
new
gowns
she
will
wear
to
the
wedding
She
goodnaturedly
points
out
that
Sansa
will
be
wearing
an
ivory
gown
as
the
bride
Sansa
isnt
sure
how
to
react
but
Cersei
presses
her
to
respond
Sansa
parrots
the
usual
lines
that
she
looks
forward
to
being
married
to
Joffrey
In
order
to
strengthen
House
Lannisters
political
position
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Hand
of
the
King
Tyrion
Lannister
makes
plans
to
forge
a
marriagealliance
with
House
Martell
of
Dorne
by
having
Princess
Myrcella
wed
to
Trystane
Martell
the
youngest
child
of
the
current
ruler
of
Dorne
In
return
House
Martell
would
hopefully
supply
soldiers
to
the
Lannisters
side
or
at
least
ensure
they
wouldnt
openly
side
with
their
enemies
Myrcella
makes
small
talk
with
Sansa
at
dinner
The
actual
marriage
ceremony
will
wait
until
Myrcella
is
old
enough
but
part
of
the
arrangement
involves
sending
her
to
Dorne
to
live
in
the
Martell
household
Queen
Cersei
is
furious
with
Tyrion
when
she
hears
from
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
what
he
is
planning
declaring
that
she
wont
let
her
only
daughter
be
shipped
off
to
Dorne
as
she
was
shipped
off
to
Robert
Baratheon
Tyrion
counters
that
as
a
princess
many
would
say
that
Myrcella
was
born
to
one
day
forge
a
marriage
alliance
and
she
will
be
safer
in
Dorne
than
in
the
capital
city
during
a
major
civil
war
Against
Cerseis
continued
protests
Tyrion
insists
that
the
plan
has
already
been
finalized
leaving
Cersei
fuming
and
in
tears
for
her
daughter
Myrcella
plays
in
the
garden
at
Kings
Landing
Myrcella
later
plays
with
her
handmaidens
in
a
castle
garden
before
the
eyes
of
Septa
Eglantine
while
her
inebriated
mother
bitterly
criticizes
Tyrion
for
being
ready
to
seal
my
daughter
in
a
crate
so
you
can
ship
her
away
Tyrion
insists
that
she
will
be
safer
in
Dorne
and
Cersei
mocks
his
concern
for
her
Tyrion
firmly
says
that
he
is
indeed
concerned
for
Myrcellas
safety
she
is
a
sweet
innocent
girl
and
I
dont
blame
her
at
all
for
you
Myrcella
tearfully
departs
Kings

on
a
ship

for
Sunspear
accompanied

by
the
High
Septon
Myrcella
travels
to
Dorne
for
an
arranged
marriage
with
Trystane
Season
After
Jaime
returns
to
Kings
Landing
Cersei
lists
off
to
him
all
she
has
suffered
since
he
left
for
the
war
over
two
years
ago
one
of
which
is
that
their
daughter
Myrcella
has
been
shipped
off
to
Dorne
to
secure
a
political
marriagealliance
During
the
royal
wedding
between
King
Joffrey
and
Margaery
Tyrell
Prince
Oberyn
Martell
encounters
Lord
Tywin
the
man
he
holds
responsible
for
letting
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
rape
and
kill
his
sister
Elia
during
the
Sack
of
Kings
Landing
and
also
killing
her
two
children
Oberyn
introduces
his
paramour
Ellaria
Sand
to
Myrcellas
mother
Cersei
The
four
of
them
exchange
smiling
pleasantries
which
barely
hide
their
underlying
and
mutual
loathing
for
each
other
At
the
end
of
their
encounter
Oberyn
casually
points
out
that
Myrcella
is
still
in
Dorne
while
Oberyn
hints
that
a
ward
can
easily
become
nothing
more
than
a
hostage
he
also
taunts
Cersei
and
Tywin
by
stating
that
murdering
little
girls
is
frowned
upon
in
Dorne
Tommen
is
crowned
king
after
Joffrey
is
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
making
Myrcella
the
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne
as
Stannis
is
in
open
rebellion
and
thus
held
as
an
unlawful
claimant
While
conversing
with
Oberyn
Cersei
laments
that
she
has
not
seen
Myrcella
in
over
a
year
Oberyn
informs
her
that
the
last
time
he
saw
Myrcella
she
was
swimming
with
two
of
his
daughters
in
the
Water
Gardens
laughing
in
the
sun
Cersei
states
that
she
wants
to
believe
this
story
and
that
Myrcella
is
happy
Oberyn
gives
her
his
word
stating
again
that
they
do
not
hurt
little
girls
in
Dorne
Cersei
replies
that
they
hurt
little
girls
everywhere
in
the
world
Cersei
asks
Oberyn
to
bring
Myrcella
a
gift
from
her
as
she
missed
her
nameday
and
does
not
know
when
she
will
see
her
again
Oberyn
agrees
and
Cersei
points
to
a
ship
that
the
best
shipwrights
in
Kings
Landing
have
been
building
for
months
declaring
that
Myrcella
loves
the
open
water
Oberyn
promises
to
have
it
sailed
down
to
Sunspear
for
Myrcella
Cersei
asks
him
to
please
tell
Myrcella
that
her
mother
misses
her
very
much
Later
Oberyn
meets
with
Tyrion
in
his
prison
cell
and
recounts
his
meeting
with
Cersei
Oberyn
says
he
halfsuspects
that
Cersei
was
actually
lying
and
was
exaggerating
how
much
she
misses
Myrcella
in
order
to
guilt
him
into
siding
with
her
against
Tyrion
during
the
trial
though
her
performance
was
so
convincing
that
part
of
him
also
wonders
if
it
was
true
Tyrion
explains
that
the
trouble
with
Cersei
is
that
she
mixes
lies
with
truth
to
suit
her
own
ends
part
of
her
is
worried
about
Myrcella
but
she
isnt
above
cynically
using
this
grief
to
gain
sympathy
from
others
Season
Myrcella
with
Trystane
in
the
Water
Gardens
Myrcella
walks
through
the
Water
Gardens
with
her
betrothed
Trystane
Martell
whom
she
has
fallen
in
love
with
while
being
watched
by
Ellaria
Sand
and
Prince
Doran
Martell
Ellaria
still
furious
about
Oberyns
death
offers
to
torture
and
mutilate
Myrcella
and
send
pieces
of
her
back
to
take
revenge
on
Cersei
whom
she
deems
responsible
for
orchestrating
Tyrions
show
trial
which
led
to
the
trial
by
combat
that
claimed
Oberyns
life
but
Doran
staunchly
refuses
to
harm
the
girl
As
Myrcella
and
Trystane
are
wandering
the
Water
Gardens
Myrcella
questions
Trystane
as
to
if
he
truly
loves
her
or
is
only
indifferent
towards
their
arranged
pairing
Trystane
affirms
that
he
has
true
affections
for
her
They
are
once
again
observed
by
Prince
Doran
who
muses
to
his
guard
Areo
Hotah
that
a
Lannister
and
Martell
pairing
is
indeed
very
dangerous
Myrcella
is
surprised
to
see
her
uncle
Jaime
Lannister
after
he
and
Bronn
finally
locate
her
as
she
is
kissing
Trystane
in
the
gardens
She
is
upset
after
Bronn
is
forced
to
knock
her
betrothed
unconscious
and
struggles
against
Jaimes
advances
to
leave
with
him
The
Sand
Snakes
on
Ellarias
orders
make
a
sudden
ambush
in
order
to
kidnap
Myrcella
She
is
nearly
taken
hostage
by
Nymeria
Sand
but
the
conflict
is
mediated
after
Areo
Hotah
arrives
with
a
dozen
Dornish
guards
imprisoning
Jaime
Bronn
the
Sand
Snakes
and
Ellaria
Myrcella
visits
Jaime
Myrcella
visits
Jaime
in
custody
Jaime
tells
her
that
the
situation
has
grown
dangerous
and
he
needs
to
take
her
home
back
to
Kings
Landing
Myrcella
failing
to
understand
after
almost
being
kidnapped
by
the
same
girls
she
believed
were
her
friends
states
that
Dorne
is
her
home
now
and
she
will
stay
and
marry
Trystane
before
leaving
Jaime
alone
Myrcella
is
then
seen
seated
next
to
Trystane
at
the
meeting
between
the
Martells
and
Jaime
When
her
uncle
remarks
that
she
must
be
cold
in
her
dress
implying
he
doesnt
approve
of
the
more
revealing
style
of
Dornish
clothing
Myrcella
coolly
replies
that
she
is
not
and
that
the
warmer
climate
agrees
with
her
thereby
upholding
and
reasserting
her
commitment
to
Dorne
and
her
new
life
and
also
demonstrating
how
much
she
has
flourished
there
When
Jaime
states
that
her
brother
Tommen
wishes
her
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
she
is
both
nonplussed
and
bothered
but
she
is
palliated
when
Doran
calls
for
her
engagement
to
his
son
to
continue
and
that
he
join
her
in
the
capital
a
request
Jaime
agrees
to
When
Ellaria
later
visits
Jaime
she
reveals
that
she
knows
Myrcella
is
his
daughter
born
of
incest
with
Cersei
Ellaria
admits
that
she
is
aware
of
Myrcellas
innocence
and
that
she
is
not
affiliated
with
Oberyns
murder
in
an
apologetic
manner
though
Jaime
is
not
entirely
convinced
Myrcella
collapses
and
dies
in
her
father
Jaimes
arms
At
the
harbor
Myrcella
says
her
farewells
to
Prince
Doran
and
Ellaria
before
departing
for
Kings
Landing
Ellaria
taking
her
vengeance
kisses
her
after
coating
a
fatal
poison
on
her
lips
thus
sealing
the
young
girls
fate
On
board
the
boat
Myrcella
reveals
to
Jaime
that
she
has
always
known
of
his
and
Cerseis
incestuous
relationship
and
that
he
is
her
true
father
The
two
of
them
share
a
tender
moment
before
the
effects
of
the
poison
become
apparent
Jaime
holds
Myrcella
as
she
falls
blood
running
from
her
nose
Season
Jaime
and
Tommen
view
Myrcellas
remains
Myrcellas
body
is
returned
to
Kings
Landing
with
Jaime
Cersei
waits
at
the
port
and
immediately
realizes
from
Jaimes
sullen
expression
that
they
were
too
late
to
save
Myrcella
from
the
Martells
Jaime
and
Cersei
are
aware
that
Doran
Martell
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
correctly
guessing
Ellaria
Sand
and
the
Sand
Snakes
were
the
ones
behind
it
Though
Jaime
sends
a
letter
to
Doran
demanding
the
heads
of
Ellaria
Obara
Nymeria
and
Tyene
for
murdering
Myrcella
the
Sands
kill
Doran
and
Trystane
and
take
over
Dorne
Myrcella
is
laid
to
rest
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
with
Jaime
and
Tommen
standing
vigil
To
their
fury
however
the
High
Sparrow
does
not
let
Cersei
attend
Myrcellas
body
is
garbed
in
a
golden
gown
confirming
the
prophecy
that
Cerseis
children
would
all
have
gold
burial
shrouds
Myrcellas
body
is
presumably
destroyed
when
her
mother
has
the
Great
Sept
destroyed
with
wildfire
It
is
later
revealed
that
Ellaria
Sand
and
the
Sand
Snakes
have
pledged
allegiance
to
Daenerys
Targaryen
after
hearing
of
her
alliance
with
Yara
and
Theon
Greyjoy
Daenerys
however
has
named
Myrcellas
uncle
Tyrion
as
her
Hand
of
the
Queen
and
whether
or
not
Tyrion
will
demand
justice
or
seek
revenge
against
Ellaria
for
his
nieces
murder
remains
to
be
seen
Season
During
a
meeting
at
Daenerys
Targaryens
council
Tyrion
and
Ellaria
argue
over
her
death
Tyrion
states
that
Myrcella
was
an
innocent
girl
to
which
Ellaria
responds
she
was
killed
due
to
her
Lannister
blood
and
that
her
greatest
regret
was
that
Oberyn
died
fighting
for
Tyrions
life
Euron
Greyjoy
later
attacks
Daeneryss
fleet
and
takes
Ellaria
and
Tyene
captive
intent
on
delivering
them
to
Cersei
to
answer
for
Myrcellas
murder
Tyene
and
Ellaria
are
brought
before
Cersei
who
has
them
placed
inside
a
dungeon
where
she
proceeds
to
kiss
Tyene
with
lips
coated
with
the
Long
Farewell
the
exact
same
poison
that
the
Sands
used
to
kill
her
daughter
and
leaves
her
to
die
with
Ellaria
watching
thus
avenging
Myrcella
Personality
Described
as
sweet
and
innocent
by
Tyrion
Lannister
Myrcella
is
effectively
the
complete
opposite
of
Cersei
and
Joffrey
While
Joffrey
is
a
villainous
psychopath
Myrcella
as
well
as
Tommen
is
a
kind
and
caring
individual
While
at
Winterfell
despite
not
known
Bran
Stark
all
that
well
she
expresses
concern
for
his
wellbeing
and
is
visibly
happy
to
hear
that
he
will
live
a
possibility
is
that
she
had
a
crush
on
Bran
which
went
no
further
after
the
Lannisters
returned
to
Kings
Landing
After
the
outbreak
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Myrcella
continues
to
be
kind
to
Sansa
Stark
despite
her
older
brother
Robb
being
the
Lannisters
primary
enemy
at
the
time
Having
grown
a
little
older
Myrcella
appears
to
be
looking
forward
to
Sansa
and
Joffreys
wedding
partly
due
to
the
dress
she
will
be
wearing
though
she
makes
a
point
to
mention
the
nicer
dress
Sansa
will
wear
as
the
bride
Her
relationship
with
Joffrey
is
not
elaborated
on
much
but
Myrcella
is
shown
to
love
her
family
to
the
point
that
she
cries
while
leaving
for
Dorne
despite
the
intention
to
keep
her
safe
from
Stannis
Baratheon
During
her
years
in
Dorne
Myrcella
matures
greatly
and
learns
to
become
somewhat
independent
of
her
family
after
falling
in
love
with
Trystane
Martell
and
looking
up
to
Doran
Martell
as
a
surrogate
father
When
Jaime
Lannister
arrives
in
Dorne
to
rescue
her
from
Ellaria
Sand
Myrcella
appears
more
surprised
than
happy
to
see
her
uncle
and
refuses
more
than
once
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
with
him
It
is
only
when
Trystane
is
ordered
to
accompany
her
that
she
agrees
given
her
love
for
her
betrothed
Her
relationship
with
Robert
Baratheon
her
legal
father
seems
to
have
been
somewhat
distant
as
with
Joffrey
and
Tommen
since
when
Myrcella
tells
Jaime
that
she
knows
he
is
her
real
father
despite
the
taboo
against
incest
she
expresses
happiness
implying
that
she
held
a
lot
more
respect
for
Jaime
than
she
did
for
Robert
However
one
of
her
greatest
flaws
is
her
naivete
After
Oberyn
Martell
is
killed
more
than
one
threat
is
made
towards
Myrcella
the
first
being
the
theft
of
her
necklace
which
she
simply
assumes
was
stolen
from
her
room
instead
of
suspecting
Ellaria
Even
after
the
Sand
Snakes
attempt
to
kidnap
her
from
the
Water
Gardens
and
Ellaria
shows
obvious
anger
when
Doran
arranges
for
her
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
Myrcellas
innocence
gets
the
better
of
her
one
last
time
and
she
foolishly
allows
Ellaria
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
and
poison
her
very
easily
falling
for
Ellarias
apology
despite
her
so
openly
having
threatened
her
life

times

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Myrcella
is
a
quiet
obedient
and
honest
girl
eight
years
old
when
the
events
of
the
books
begin
Myrcella
is
a
year
younger
than
Arya
Stark
and
a
year
older
than
Bran
Stark
She
is
said
to
have
inherited
her
mothers
beautiful
looks
but
none
of
her
personality
Her
mother
dotes
on
her
and
is
keen
that
she
does
not
suffer
Cerseis
fate
of
being
sold
in
a
political
marriage
without
love
Like
all
of
Cerseis
children
she
was
mostly
ignored
by
King
Robert
While
Cersei
felt
she
doted
on
all
of
her
children
she
is
more
attached
to
her
own
mental
constructs
of
them
than
the
reality
As
Cerseis
loveless
marriage
with
Robert
dragged
on
year
after
year
she
increasingly
fantasized
about
how
Joffrey
would
one
day
succeed
Robert
and
become
a
great
king
himself
never
acknowledging
that
he
was
really
a
petulant
sociopath
Ironically
despite
Cerseis
defiant
claims
and
even
earnest
belief
that
she
is
a
devoted
mother
to
all
of
her
children
she
actually
became
so
obsessed
with
Joffrey
and
her
fantasies
about
him
that
she
all
but
ignored
Myrcella
and
Tommen
throughout
their
lives
From
the
moment
she
gave
birth
to
Joffrey
Cersei
dreamed
about
the
great
king
he
would
grow
into
and
how
as
Jaimes
secret
son
he
would
be
her
ultimate
revenge
on
Robert
the
births
of
her
two
subsequent
children
were
barely
an
anecdote
in
the
narrative
of
this
mental
fantasy
which
already
been
established
in
her
mind
years
before
Her
younger
children
were
pushed
off
to
the
side
and
with
Robert
a
nonfactor
in
their
lives
as
well
they
were
functionally
raised
by
court
servants
such
as
Septa
Eglantine
Even
so
Cersei
will
still
become
hypocritically
enraged
when
anyone
questions
her
relationship
with
her
younger
children
TV
viewers
who
havent
read
the
books
may
find
it
odd
that
while
the
children
of
the
current
generation
of
House
Stark
are
given
a
large
amount
of
screentime
even
Arya
or
Bran
the
younger
children
of
the
current
generation
of
House
Lannister
barely
appear
at
all
This
is
much
as
it
was
in
the
earlier
books
of
the
series
and
is
actually
a
key
plot
point
the
almost
total
absence
of
Myrcella
and
Tommen
from
the
inner
dynamics
of
House
Lannister
is
indicative
of
just
how
little
importance
they
have
to
Cersei
People
are
aware
they
exist
but
rarely
even
pause
to
consider
treating
them
as
individuals
with
their
own
emotions
or
agendas
between
the
two
of
them
they
had
only
a
single
throwaway
speaking
line
in
the
entire
first
season
is
Bran
going
to
die
Rickon
Stark
had
more
dialogue
in
Season
than
both
of
them
combined
At
best
Cersei
will
argue
over
their
treatment
on
general
principle
such
as
when
she
opposed
selling
Myrcella
of
to
a
political
marriage
in
Dorne
However
Cersei
was
more
angered
in
the
sense
that
she
felt
something
was
being
taken
which
belonged
to
her
notice
that
neither
the
books
nor
TV
series
includes
a
scene
in
which
Cersei
discusses
news
of
the
marriage
proposal
with
Myrcella
Thus
it
is
all
the
more
shocking
when
in
later
books
as
they
grow
older
Myrcella
and
Tommen
increasingly
turn
into
major
characters
in
the
very
midst
of
House
Lannister
on
the
scale
of
Arya
or
Bran
Stark
where
before
they
were
treated
as
nonentities
The
other
family
members
and
courtiers
and
by
extension
the
readers
or
TV
viewers
are
even
criticized
for
ignoring
them
this
entire
time
and
simply
assuming
they
were
content
The
smiling
children
seen
in
public
at
the
Tourney
of
the
Hand
in
bookSeason
hide
a
darker
and
empty
family
life
Later
books
also
retroactively
reveal
that
Tommen
and
maybe
Myrcella
too
have
lived
in
terror
of
Joffrey
their
entire
lives
Joffrey
killed
and
skinned
a
pet
fawn
of
Tommen
yet
Cersei
continued
to
dote
on
him
At
one
point
Tommen
even
says
that
he
used
to
go
away
inside
mentally
when
Joffrey
did
certain
things
to
him
though
the
exact
extent
of
what
he
did
killing
his
pet
or
something
far
more
sinister
has
not
been
made
clear
It
is
not
mentioned
or
implied
if
Joffrey
abused
Myrcella
too
However
despite
their
parents
loveless
marriage
absent
father
sociopathic
and
abusive
older
brother
willfully
blind
and
functionally
absent
mother
Myrcella
and
Tommen
still
seem
to
have
a
good
and
genuinely
loving
relationship
between
the
two
of
them
as
fellowsufferers
sharing
a
household
with
Cersei
and
Joffrey
Tommen
goes
to
the
tournament
for
Joffreys
nameday
having
been
given
permission
by
Cersei
to
do
a
practice
mounted
joust
against
a
quintain
with
a
straw
filled
mannequin
as
his
opponent
Joffrey
sees
that
the
quality
of
the
jousting
is
poor
the
Hound
says
they
are
all
gnats
and
Ser
Dontos
Hollard
shows
up
drunk
and
Joffrey
decides
to
cancel
the
whole
thing
Tommen
and
Myrcella
protest
as
Cersei
said
Tommen
could
take
part
and
Joffrey
cant
just
cancel
it
When
Joffrey
says
they
are
acting
childish
Myrcella
responds
We
are
children
We
are
supposed
to
act
childish
The
Hound
laughs
and
says
Shes
got
you
there
and
Joffrey
relents
Myrcella
doesnt
cry
when
she
is
sent
away
on
the
ship
to
Dorne
In
fact
she
comforts
Tommen
who
is
crying
Myrcellas
ship
actually
doesnt
sail
directly
to
Dorne
but
rather
sails
to
the
Free
City
of
Braavos
across
the
Narrow
Sea
in
order
to
meet
on
neutral
ground
as
well
as
to
lessen
the
risk
of
Stanniss
forces
capturing
Myrcellas
ship
and
killing
her
before
the
alliance
can
be
finalised
When
they
reach
Braavos
Myrcella
and
her
attendants
are
received
by
Dornish
envoys
who
in
turn
transport
them
back
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
Dorne
After
Joffrey
is
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
several
Martell
characters
remark
that
they
are
baffled
at
how
Cersei
doted
on
her
psychopathic
eldest
son
to
the
exclusion
of
her
younger
children
when
Myrcella
is
actually
the
kind
of
born
ruler
that
Joffrey
never
was
While
Cersei
barely
paid
attention
to
her
daughter
the
Martells
discover
that
she
is
preternaturally
more
intelligent
than
many
adults
despite
being
only
eleven
years
old
brave
from
living
through
Joffreys
torments
as
well
as
kind
and
a
natural
leader
due
to
defending
her
little
brother
Tommen
from
Joffrey
when
she
could
They
also
find
her
to
be
quickwitted
and
with
a
polite
courtesy
that
Cersei
never
expressed
Just
as
Tyrion
was
the
only
one
of
Tywins
three
children
to
inherit
his
keen
mind
Myrcella
was
the
only
one
of
Cerseis
three
children
to
inherit
the
famous
intellect
running
in
the
family
meaning
that
Myrcella
is
essentially
the
intellect
of
Tywin
or
Tyrion
put
in
the
beautiful
body
of
a
young
teenaged
Cersei
combined
with
Tyrions
sympathy
for
the
downtrodden
As
much
as
the
Sand
Snakes
hate
the
Lannisters
and
wish
to
exact
revenge
they
and
Ellaria
Sand
have
no
personal
grudge
against
Myrcella
and
do
not
intend
to
harm
her
Tyene
Sand
has
a
plan
that
involves
Myrcella
according
to
Dornish
law
she
is
Joffreys
rightful
heir
because
in
Dorne
it
is
the
eldest
living
child
not
the
eldest
living
son
that
inherits
Since
Dornishmen
fight
best
at
home
she
suggests
her
uncle
to
crown
Myrcella
in
order
to
incite
the
Lannisters
and
the
Tyrells
into
attacking
Dorne
then
the
Dornish
shall
bleed
them
in
the
passes
and
bury
them
beneath
the
blowing
sands
Prince
Doran
says
grudgingly
he
will
think
about
that
After
Tyene
leaves
Doran
orders
to
arrest
her
and
the
other
Sand
Snakes
to
make
certain
they
will
not
push
Dorne
into
a
war
However
his
daughter
Arianne
attempts
to
carry
out
Tyenes
plan
and
seduces
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
for
that
purpose
Trystane
is
not
involved
in
the
plan
and
it
is
unknown
if
he
is
aware
of
it
While
Arianne
Myrcella
and
their
escorts
are
on
their
way
to
Hellholt
where
Arianne
intends
to
crown
Myrcella
they
are
intercepted
and
arrested
by
Areo
Hotah
During
the
confusion
moments
Ser
Gerold
Darkstar
Dayne
who
tried
to
persuade
Arianne
to
kill
Myrcella
rather
than
crowning
her
slashes
at
her
and
escapes
Luckily
her
horse
recoils
otherwise
she
would
have
lost
her
head
Maester
Caleotte
saves
her
life
but
no
treatment
can
restore
her
horribly
disfigured
face
she
loses
an
ear
and
has
a
hideous
facial
scar
Dayne
flees
from
Dorne
and
Doran
Martell
issues
a
manhunt
for
him
Her
death
in
the
television
series
however
implies
that
she
will
die
in
a
later
novel
Cersei
who
has
no
reason
to
suspect
Myrcella
is
in
danger
unlike
in
show
no
threat
is
sent
to
Cersei
from
Dorne
sends
Ser
Balon
Swann
of
the
Kingsguard
to
Dorne
to
bring
her
back
Doran
is
worried
that
the
Lannisters
will
hold
the
Martells
responsible
for
Myrcellas
injury
To
buy
time
he
sends
Myrcella
to
the
Water
Gardens
and
orders
his
bannermen
to
delay
Ser
Balon
by
holding
feasts
and
hunting
trips
for
him
Doran
consults
with
his
daughter
and
nieces
and
they
come
up
with
a
solution
Myrcella
instructed
by
Arianne
will
tell
Ser
Balon
that
Darkstar
tried
to
kill
her
lie
about
Ser
Arys
Oakhearts
part
in
the
incident
and
ask
him
to
capture
the
man
who
hurt
her
so
severely
As
Doran
predicts
Ser
Balon
believes
the
partlyfalse
story
and
is
unable
to
refuse
Myrcellas
request
After
sending
a
report
to
Kings
Landing
he
and
Obara
go
to
High
Hermitage
chasing
Darkstar
Cersei
is
shocked
and
saddened
to
hear
the
news
about
Myrcella
from
Kevan
She
has
no
idea
who
is
Darkstar
and
why
he
intended
to
harm
Myrcella
Recalling
how
Tyrion
was
disfigured
by
Ser
Mandon
Moore
at
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
she
claims
that
Tyrion
is
behind
the
attempt
on
her
daughters
life
and
Darkstar
is
his
catspaw
Currently
Myrcella
is
on
her
way
back
to
Kings
Landing
accompanied
by
Nymeria
Sand
Trystane
has
stayed
at
Sunspear
after
a
tearful
parting
from
her
While
Myrcella
might
have
suspected
that
Jaime
is
her
true
father
based
on
rumors
and
the
letters
Stannis
spread
all
over
Westeros
she
never
says
that
to
him
or
anyone
else
Besides
which
she
has
not
seen
Jaime
since
he
left
Kings
Landing
to
command
one
of
his
fathers
armies
in
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
He
never
goes
to
Dorne
to
try
and
rescue
her
Jaime
considers
revealing
to
Myrcella
that
he
is
her
father
but
fears
of
the
applications
he
thinks
Doran
Martell
has
betrothed
Myrcella
to
his
son
in
the
belief
that
she
was
Roberts
blood
and
revealing
the
truth
may
result
in
the
breaking
of
the
betrothal
Jaime
is
unaware
that
the
Martells
know
the
truth
about
Cerseis
children
based
on
Stanniss
letters
Previously
it
was
thought
that
Myrcellas
death
in
the
Season
finale
indicated
that
she
would
die
in
the
next
upcoming
novel
albeit
with
the
circumstances
moved
around
somewhat
Now
given
the
drastic
changes
to
the
Martell
storyline
in
Season
there
is
no
strong
reason
to
take
Myrcellas
death
in
the
TV
series
as
reflecting
that
she
will
in
fact
die
in
the
next
novel
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and
crew
Myrcella
is
pronounced
MerSELLuh
as
opposed
to
MERsulluh
that
is
it
doesnt
rhyme
with
Ursula
Myrcellas
age
in
the
TV
continuity
The
TV
series
never
directly
mentioned
Myrcellas
age
at
any
point
in
time
complicated
by
the
fact
that
she
didnt
appear
at
all
in
Seasons
and
and
the
role
was
recast
when
she
returned
in
Season
In
the
first
novel
Joffrey
is
twelve
Myrcella
is
eight
and
Tommen
is
seven
The
TV
series
agedup
many
younger
characters
by
two
years
pushing
the
beginning
of
Roberts
Rebellion
from
years
before
to
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
narrative
because
it
is
a
plot
point
that
characters
such
as
Daenerys
Targaryen
Robb
Stark
and
Jon
Snow
were
born
during
events
surrounding
the
war
The
TV
series
increased
Joffreys
age
however
not
by
two
years
but
by
four
years
so
that
he
was
actually
in
Season
actor
Jack
Gleeson
was
actually
years
old
in
Season
the
producers
cast
an
older
and
more
experienced
actor
due
to
the
narrative
weight
the
role
needed
to
carry
The
original
Myrcella
actress
Aimee
Richardson
assumed
that
the
character
was
around
years
old
in
Season
though
she
said
she
was
only
guessing
Because
Myrcella
is
the
middle
child
she
logically
couldnt
have
been
born
less
than
about
one
year
months
or
so
younger
than
Joffrey
and
Tommen
cant
be
less
than
one
year
or
so
younger
than
her
Following
the
general
principle
followed
in
the
TV
series
that
one
TV
season
equals
one
year
of
story
time
Joffrey
would
have
been
years
old
in
Season
so
Myrcella
couldnt
have
been
more
than
about
at
the
same
time
Meanwhile
the
TV
series
apparently
retconned
how
old
TVTommen
is
when
the
role
was
recast
in
Season
so
that
he
is
apparently
around
years
old
in
Season
he
has
to
be
above
the
legal
age
of
adulthood
in
Westeros
because
it
is
explicitly
stated
that
he
no
longer
has
a
regent
With
Tommens
age
pushed
up
to
around
in
Season
and
Joffreys
more
firmly
established
birth
date
meaning
he
would
have
been
in
Season
had
he
lived
the
only
possible
scenario
is
for
Myrcella
to
have
been
years
old
in
Season

is
more
beautiful
than
ever
When

callously
says
that
they
had
heard
he
was
dead

tells

that
she
is
glad

rumors

not
true
Myrcella
attends
a
tense
dinner
with
her
younger

her
mother
Cersei
and

Stark
Myrcella
naively
makes
smalltalk
with

asking

explains
it

after

excited
for

new
gowns
she
will
wear
to
the
wedding

goodnaturedly
points
out
that

ivory
gown
as
the
bride
Sansa
isnt
sure
how
to
react

Princess
Myrcella
wed
to
Trystane
Martell
the
youngest
child
of
the
current
ruler
of
Dorne
In
return
House
Martell
would
hopefully
supply
soldiers
to
the
Lannisters
side
or
at
least
ensure
they
wouldnt
openly
side
with
their
enemies
Myrcella
makes
small
talk
with
Sansa
at
dinner
The
actual
marriage
ceremony
will
wait
until

enough

of
the
arrangement
involves
sending
her
to
Dorne
to
live
in
the
Martell
household
Queen
Cersei
is
furious
with
Tyrion
when
she
hears
from
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
what
he
is
planning
declaring
that
she
wont
let
her
only
daughter
be
shipped
off
to
Dorne
as
she
was
shipped
off
to
Robert
Baratheon
Tyrion
counters
that
as
a
princess
many
would
say
that
Myrcella
was
born
to
one
day
forge
a
marriage
alliance
and
she
will
be
safer
in
Dorne
than
in
the
capital
city
during
a
major
civil
war
Against
Cerseis
continued
protests
Tyrion
insists
that
the
plan
has
already
been
finalized

fuming
and
in
tears
for
her
daughter
Myrcella
plays
in
the
garden
at
Kings
Landing
Myrcella
later
plays
with
her
handmaidens
in
a
castle
garden
before
the
eyes
of
Septa
Eglantine
while
her
inebriated
mother
bitterly
criticizes
Tyrion
for
being
ready
to
seal
my
daughter
in
a
crate
so
you
can
ship
her
away
Tyrion
insists
that
she
will
be
safer
in
Dorne
and
Cersei
mocks
his
concern
for
her
Tyrion
firmly
says
that
he
is
indeed
concerned
for
Myrcellas
safety
she
is
a
sweet
innocent
girl
and
I
dont
blame
her
at
all
for
you
Myrcella
tearfully
departs

on
a
ship
bound
for

Arys
Oakheart
of

Kingsguard

off
at

by

formal
royal
procession
including
King
Joffrey
Prince
Tommen
Queen
Cersei
Acting
Hand
of

with
prayers
for

and
her
safe
journey
delivered
by
the
High
Septon
Myrcella
travels
to
Dorne
for
an
arranged
marriage
with
Trystane
Season
After
Jaime
returns
to
Kings
Landing
Cersei
lists
off
to
him
all
she
has
suffered
since
he
left
for
the
war
over
two
years
ago
one
of
which
is
that
their
daughter
Myrcella
has
been
shipped
off
to
Dorne
to
secure
a
political
marriagealliance
During
the
royal
wedding
between
King
Joffrey
and
Margaery
Tyrell
Prince
Oberyn
Martell
encounters
Lord
Tywin
the
man
he
holds
responsible
for
letting
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
rape
and
kill
his
sister
Elia
during
the
Sack
of
Kings
Landing
and
also
killing
her
two
children
Oberyn
introduces
his
paramour
Ellaria
Sand
to
Myrcellas
mother
Cersei
The
four
of
them
exchange
smiling
pleasantries
which
barely
hide
their
underlying
and
mutual
loathing
for
each
other
At
the
end
of
their
encounter
Oberyn
casually
points
out
that
Myrcella
is
still
in
Dorne
while
Oberyn
hints
that
a
ward
can
easily
become
nothing
more
than
a
hostage
he
also
taunts
Cersei
and
Tywin
by
stating
that
murdering
little
girls
is
frowned
upon
in
Dorne
Tommen
is
crowned
king
after
Joffrey
is
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
making
Myrcella
the
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne
as
Stannis
is
in
open
rebellion
and
thus
held
as
an
unlawful
claimant
While
conversing
with
Oberyn
Cersei
laments
that
she
has
not
seen
Myrcella
in
over
a
year
Oberyn
informs
her
that
the
last
time
he
saw
Myrcella
she
was
swimming
with
two
of
his
daughters
in
the
Water
Gardens
laughing
in
the
sun
Cersei
states
that
she
wants
to
believe
this
story
and
that
Myrcella
is
happy
Oberyn
gives
her
his
word
stating
again
that
they
do
not
hurt
little
girls
in
Dorne
Cersei
replies
that
they
hurt
little
girls
everywhere
in
the
world
Cersei
asks
Oberyn
to
bring
Myrcella
a
gift
from
her
as
she
missed
her
nameday
and
does
not
know
when
she
will
see
her
again
Oberyn
agrees
and
Cersei
points
to
a
ship
that
the
best
shipwrights
in
Kings
Landing
have
been
building
for
months
declaring
that
Myrcella
loves
the
open
water
Oberyn
promises
to
have
it
sailed
down
to
Sunspear
for
Myrcella
Cersei
asks
him
to
please
tell
Myrcella
that
her
mother
misses
her
very
much
Later
Oberyn
meets
with
Tyrion
in
his
prison
cell
and
recounts
his
meeting
with
Cersei
Oberyn
says
he
halfsuspects
that
Cersei
was
actually
lying
and
was
exaggerating
how
much
she
misses
Myrcella
in
order
to
guilt
him
into
siding
with
her
against
Tyrion
during
the
trial
though
her
performance
was
so
convincing
that
part
of
him
also
wonders
if
it
was
true
Tyrion
explains
that
the
trouble
with
Cersei
is
that
she
mixes
lies
with
truth
to
suit
her
own
ends
part
of
her
is
worried
about
Myrcella
but
she
isnt
above
cynically
using
this
grief
to
gain
sympathy
from
others
Season
Myrcella
with
Trystane
in
the
Water
Gardens
Myrcella
walks
through
the
Water
Gardens
with
her
betrothed
Trystane
Martell
whom
she
has
fallen
in
love
with
while
being
watched
by
Ellaria
Sand
and
Prince
Doran
Martell
Ellaria
still
furious
about
Oberyns
death
offers
to
torture
and
mutilate
Myrcella
and
send
pieces
of
her
back
to
take
revenge
on
Cersei
whom
she
deems
responsible
for
orchestrating
Tyrions
show
trial
which
led
to
the
trial
by
combat
that
claimed
Oberyns
life
but
Doran
staunchly
refuses
to
harm
the
girl
As
Myrcella
and
Trystane
are
wandering
the
Water
Gardens
Myrcella
questions
Trystane
as
to
if
he
truly
loves
her
or
is
only
indifferent
towards
their
arranged
pairing
Trystane
affirms
that
he
has
true
affections
for
her
They
are
once
again
observed
by
Prince
Doran
who
muses
to
his
guard
Areo
Hotah
that
a
Lannister
and
Martell
pairing
is
indeed
very
dangerous
Myrcella
is
surprised
to
see
her
uncle
Jaime
Lannister
after
he
and
Bronn
finally
locate
her
as
she
is
kissing
Trystane
in
the
gardens
She
is
upset
after
Bronn
is
forced
to
knock
her
betrothed
unconscious
and
struggles
against
Jaimes
advances
to
leave
with
him
The
Sand
Snakes
on
Ellarias
orders
make
a
sudden
ambush
in
order
to
kidnap
Myrcella
She
is
nearly
taken
hostage
by
Nymeria
Sand
but
the
conflict
is
mediated
after
Areo
Hotah
arrives
with
a
dozen
Dornish
guards
imprisoning
Jaime
Bronn
the
Sand
Snakes
and
Ellaria
Myrcella

in
custody
Jaime
tells
her
that
the
situation
has
grown
dangerous
and
he
needs
to
take
her
home
back
to
Kings
Landing
Myrcella
failing
to
understand
after
almost
being
kidnapped
by
the
same
girls
she
believed
were
her
friends
states
that
Dorne
is
her
home
now
and
she
will
stay
and
marry
Trystane
before
leaving
Jaime
alone
Myrcella
is
then
seen
seated
next
to
Trystane
at
the
meeting
between
the
Martells
and
Jaime
When
her
uncle
remarks
that
she
must
be
cold
in
her
dress
implying
he
doesnt
approve
of
the
more
revealing
style
of
Dornish
clothing
Myrcella
coolly
replies
that
she
is
not
and
that
the
warmer
climate
agrees
with
her
thereby
upholding
and
reasserting
her
commitment
to
Dorne
and
her
new
life
and
also
demonstrating
how
much
she
has
flourished
there
When
Jaime
states
that
her
brother
Tommen
wishes
her
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
she
is
both
nonplussed
and
bothered
but
she
is
palliated
when
Doran
calls
for
her
engagement
to
his
son
to
continue
and
that
he
join
her
in
the
capital
a
request
Jaime
agrees
to
When
Ellaria
later
visits
Jaime
she
reveals
that
she
knows
Myrcella
is
his
daughter
born
of
incest
with
Cersei
Ellaria
admits
that
she
is
aware
of
Myrcellas
innocence
and
that
she
is
not
affiliated
with
Oberyns
murder
in
an
apologetic
manner
though
Jaime
is
not
entirely
convinced
Myrcella
collapses
and
dies
in
her
father
Jaimes
arms
At
the
harbor
Myrcella
says
her
farewells
to
Prince
Doran
and
Ellaria
before
departing
for
Kings
Landing
Ellaria
taking
her
vengeance
kisses
her
after
coating
a
fatal
poison
on
her
lips
thus
sealing
the
young
girls
fate
On
board
the
boat
Myrcella
reveals
to
Jaime
that
she
has
always
known
of
his
and
Cerseis
incestuous
relationship
and
that
he
is
her
true
father
The
two
of
them
share
a
tender
moment
before
the
effects
of
the
poison
become
apparent
Jaime
holds
Myrcella
as
she
falls

running
from
her
nose
Season
Jaime
and
Tommen
view
Myrcellas
remains
Myrcellas
body
is
returned
to
Kings
Landing
with
Jaime
Cersei
waits
at
the
port
and
immediately
realizes
from
Jaimes
sullen
expression
that
they
were
too
late
to
save
Myrcella
from
the
Martells
Jaime
and
Cersei
are
aware
that
Doran
Martell
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
correctly
guessing
Ellaria
Sand
and
the
Sand
Snakes
were
the
ones
behind
it
Though
Jaime
sends
a
letter
to
Doran
demanding
the
heads
of
Ellaria
Obara
Nymeria
and
Tyene
for
murdering
Myrcella
the
Sands
kill
Doran
and
Trystane
and
take
over
Dorne
Myrcella
is
laid
to
rest
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
with
Jaime
and
Tommen
standing
vigil
To
their
fury
however
the
High
Sparrow
does
not
let
Cersei
attend
Myrcellas
body
is
garbed
in
a
golden
gown
confirming
the
prophecy
that
Cerseis
children
would
all
have
gold
burial
shrouds
Myrcellas
body
is
presumably
destroyed
when
her
mother
has
the
Great
Sept
destroyed
with
wildfire
It
is
later
revealed
that
Ellaria
Sand
and
the
Sand
Snakes
have
pledged
allegiance
to
Daenerys
Targaryen
after
hearing
of
her
alliance
with
Yara
and
Theon
Greyjoy
Daenerys
however
has
named
Myrcellas
uncle
Tyrion
as
her
Hand
of
the
Queen
and
whether
or
not
Tyrion
will
demand
justice
or
seek
revenge
against
Ellaria
for
his
nieces
murder
remains
to
be
seen
Season
During
a
meeting
at
Daenerys
Targaryens
council
Tyrion
and
Ellaria
argue
over
her
death
Tyrion
states
that
Myrcella
was
an
innocent
girl
to
which
Ellaria
responds
she
was
killed
due
to
her
Lannister
blood
and
that
her
greatest
regret
was
that
Oberyn
died
fighting
for
Tyrions
life
Euron
Greyjoy
later
attacks
Daeneryss
fleet
and
takes
Ellaria
and
Tyene
captive
intent
on
delivering
them
to
Cersei
to
answer
for
Myrcellas
murder
Tyene
and
Ellaria
are
brought
before
Cersei
who
has
them
placed
inside
a
dungeon
where
she
proceeds
to
kiss
Tyene
with
lips
coated
with
the
Long
Farewell
the
exact
same
poison
that
the
Sands
used
to
kill
her
daughter
and
leaves
her
to
die
with
Ellaria
watching
thus
avenging
Myrcella
Personality
Described
as
sweet
and
innocent
by
Tyrion
Lannister
Myrcella
is
effectively
the
complete
opposite
of
Cersei
and
Joffrey
While
Joffrey
is
a
villainous
psychopath
Myrcella
as
well
as
Tommen
is
a
kind
and
caring
individual
While
at
Winterfell
despite
not
known
Bran
Stark
all
that
well
she
expresses
concern
for
his
wellbeing
and
is
visibly
happy
to
hear
that
he
will
live
a
possibility
is
that
she
had
a
crush
on
Bran
which
went
no
further
after
the
Lannisters
returned
to
Kings
Landing
After
the
outbreak
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Myrcella
continues
to
be
kind
to
Sansa
Stark
despite
her
older
brother
Robb
being
the
Lannisters
primary
enemy
at
the
time
Having
grown
a
little
older
Myrcella
appears
to
be
looking
forward
to
Sansa
and
Joffreys
wedding
partly
due
to
the
dress
she
will
be
wearing
though
she
makes
a
point
to
mention
the
nicer
dress
Sansa
will
wear
as
the
bride
Her
relationship
with
Joffrey
is
not
elaborated
on
much
but
Myrcella
is
shown
to
love
her
family
to
the
point
that
she
cries
while
leaving
for
Dorne
despite
the
intention
to
keep
her
safe
from
Stannis
Baratheon
During
her
years
in
Dorne
Myrcella
matures
greatly
and
learns
to
become
somewhat
independent
of
her
family
after
falling
in
love
with
Trystane
Martell
and
looking
up
to
Doran
Martell
as
a
surrogate
father
When
Jaime
Lannister
arrives
in
Dorne
to
rescue
her
from
Ellaria
Sand
Myrcella
appears
more
surprised
than
happy
to
see
her
uncle
and
refuses
more
than
once
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
with
him
It
is
only
when
Trystane
is
ordered
to
accompany
her
that
she
agrees
given
her
love
for
her
betrothed
Her
relationship
with
Robert
Baratheon
her
legal
father
seems
to
have
been
somewhat
distant
as
with
Joffrey
and
Tommen
since
when
Myrcella
tells
Jaime
that
she
knows
he
is
her
real
father
despite
the
taboo
against
incest
she
expresses
happiness
implying
that
she
held
a
lot
more
respect
for
Jaime
than
she
did
for
Robert
However
one
of
her
greatest
flaws
is
her
naivete
After
Oberyn
Martell
is
killed
more
than
one
threat
is
made
towards
Myrcella
the
first
being
the
theft
of
her
necklace
which
she
simply
assumes
was
stolen
from
her
room
instead
of
suspecting
Ellaria
Even
after
the
Sand
Snakes
attempt
to
kidnap
her
from
the
Water
Gardens
and
Ellaria
shows
obvious
anger
when
Doran
arranges
for
her
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
Myrcellas
innocence
gets
the
better
of
her
one
last
time
and
she
foolishly
allows
Ellaria
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
and
poison
her
very
easily
falling
for
Ellarias
apology
despite
her
so
openly
having
threatened
her
life

times

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Myrcella
is
a
quiet
obedient
and
honest
girl
eight
years
old
when
the
events
of
the
books
begin
Myrcella
is
a
year
younger
than
Arya
Stark
and
a
year
older
than
Bran
Stark
She
is
said
to
have
inherited
her
mothers
beautiful
looks
but
none
of
her
personality
Her
mother
dotes
on
her
and
is
keen
that
she
does
not
suffer
Cerseis
fate
of
being
sold
in
a
political
marriage
without
love
Like
all
of
Cerseis
children
she
was
mostly
ignored
by
King
Robert
While
Cersei
felt
she
doted
on
all
of
her
children
she
is
more
attached
to
her
own
mental
constructs
of
them
than
the
reality
As
Cerseis
loveless
marriage
with
Robert
dragged
on
year
after
year
she
increasingly
fantasized
about
how
Joffrey
would
one
day
succeed
Robert
and
become
a
great
king
himself
never
acknowledging
that
he
was
really
a
petulant
sociopath
Ironically
despite
Cerseis
defiant
claims
and
even
earnest
belief
that
she
is
a
devoted
mother
to
all
of
her
children
she
actually
became
so
obsessed
with
Joffrey
and
her
fantasies
about
him
that
she
all
but
ignored
Myrcella
and
Tommen
throughout
their
lives
From
the
moment
she
gave
birth
to
Joffrey
Cersei
dreamed
about
the
great
king
he
would
grow
into
and
how
as
Jaimes
secret
son
he
would
be
her
ultimate
revenge
on
Robert
the
births
of
her
two
subsequent
children
were
barely
an
anecdote
in
the
narrative
of
this
mental
fantasy
which
already
been
established
in
her
mind
years
before
Her
younger
children
were
pushed
off
to
the
side
and
with
Robert
a
nonfactor
in
their
lives
as
well
they
were
functionally
raised
by
court
servants
such
as
Septa
Eglantine
Even
so
Cersei
will
still
become
hypocritically
enraged
when
anyone
questions
her
relationship
with
her
younger
children
TV
viewers
who
havent
read
the
books
may
find
it
odd
that
while
the
children
of
the
current
generation
of
House
Stark
are
given
a
large
amount
of
screentime
even
Arya
or
Bran
the
younger
children
of
the
current
generation
of
House
Lannister
barely
appear
at
all
This
is
much
as
it
was
in
the
earlier
books
of
the
series
and
is
actually
a
key
plot
point
the
almost
total
absence
of
Myrcella
and
Tommen
from
the
inner
dynamics
of
House
Lannister
is
indicative
of
just
how
little
importance
they
have
to
Cersei
People
are
aware
they
exist
but
rarely
even
pause
to
consider
treating
them
as
individuals
with
their
own
emotions
or
agendas
between
the
two
of
them
they
had
only
a
single
throwaway
speaking
line
in
the
entire
first
season
is
Bran
going
to
die
Rickon
Stark
had
more
dialogue
in
Season
than
both
of
them
combined
At
best
Cersei
will
argue
over
their
treatment
on
general
principle
such
as
when
she
opposed
selling
Myrcella
of
to
a
political
marriage
in
Dorne
However
Cersei
was
more
angered
in
the
sense
that
she
felt
something
was
being
taken
which
belonged
to
her
notice
that
neither
the
books
nor
TV
series
includes
a
scene
in
which
Cersei
discusses
news
of
the
marriage
proposal
with
Myrcella
Thus
it
is
all
the
more
shocking
when
in
later
books
as
they
grow
older
Myrcella
and
Tommen
increasingly
turn
into
major
characters
in
the
very
midst
of
House
Lannister
on
the
scale
of
Arya
or
Bran
Stark
where
before
they
were
treated
as
nonentities
The
other
family
members
and
courtiers
and
by
extension
the
readers
or
TV
viewers
are
even
criticized
for
ignoring
them
this
entire
time
and
simply
assuming
they
were
content
The
smiling
children
seen
in
public
at
the
Tourney
of
the
Hand
in
bookSeason
hide
a
darker
and
empty
family
life
Later
books
also
retroactively
reveal
that
Tommen
and
maybe
Myrcella
too
have
lived
in
terror
of
Joffrey
their
entire
lives
Joffrey
killed
and
skinned
a
pet
fawn
of
Tommen
yet
Cersei
continued
to
dote
on
him
At
one
point
Tommen
even
says
that
he
used
to
go
away
inside
mentally
when
Joffrey
did
certain
things
to
him
though
the
exact
extent
of
what
he
did
killing
his
pet
or
something
far
more
sinister
has
not
been
made
clear
It
is
not
mentioned
or
implied
if
Joffrey
abused
Myrcella
too
However
despite
their
parents
loveless
marriage
absent
father
sociopathic
and
abusive
older
brother
willfully
blind
and
functionally
absent
mother
Myrcella
and
Tommen
still
seem
to
have
a
good
and
genuinely
loving
relationship
between
the
two
of
them
as
fellowsufferers
sharing
a
household
with
Cersei
and
Joffrey
Tommen
goes
to
the
tournament
for
Joffreys
nameday
having
been
given
permission
by
Cersei
to
do
a
practice
mounted
joust
against
a
quintain
with
a
straw
filled
mannequin
as
his
opponent
Joffrey
sees
that
the
quality
of
the
jousting
is
poor
the
Hound
says
they
are
all
gnats
and
Ser
Dontos
Hollard
shows
up
drunk
and
Joffrey
decides
to
cancel
the
whole
thing
Tommen
and
Myrcella
protest
as
Cersei
said
Tommen
could
take
part
and
Joffrey
cant
just
cancel
it
When
Joffrey
says
they
are
acting
childish
Myrcella
responds
We
are
children
We
are
supposed
to
act
childish
The
Hound
laughs
and
says
Shes
got
you
there
and
Joffrey
relents
Myrcella
doesnt
cry
when
she
is
sent
away
on
the
ship
to
Dorne
In
fact
she
comforts
Tommen
who
is
crying
Myrcellas
ship
actually
doesnt
sail
directly
to
Dorne
but
rather
sails
to
the
Free
City
of
Braavos
across
the
Narrow
Sea
in
order
to
meet
on
neutral
ground
as
well
as
to
lessen
the
risk
of
Stanniss
forces
capturing
Myrcellas
ship
and
killing
her
before
the
alliance
can
be
finalised
When
they
reach
Braavos
Myrcella
and
her
attendants
are
received
by
Dornish
envoys
who
in
turn
transport
them
back
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
Dorne
After
Joffrey
is
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
several
Martell
characters
remark
that
they
are
baffled
at
how
Cersei
doted
on
her
psychopathic
eldest
son
to
the
exclusion
of
her
younger
children
when
Myrcella
is
actually
the
kind
of
born
ruler
that
Joffrey
never
was
While
Cersei
barely
paid
attention
to
her
daughter
the
Martells
discover
that
she
is
preternaturally
more
intelligent
than
many
adults
despite
being
only
eleven
years
old
brave
from
living
through
Joffreys
torments
as
well
as
kind
and
a
natural
leader
due
to
defending
her
little
brother
Tommen
from
Joffrey
when
she
could
They
also
find
her
to
be
quickwitted
and
with
a
polite
courtesy
that
Cersei
never
expressed
Just
as
Tyrion
was
the
only
one
of
Tywins
three
children
to
inherit
his
keen
mind
Myrcella
was
the
only
one
of
Cerseis
three
children
to
inherit
the
famous
intellect
running
in
the
family
meaning
that
Myrcella
is
essentially
the
intellect
of
Tywin
or
Tyrion
put
in
the
beautiful
body
of
a
young
teenaged
Cersei
combined
with
Tyrions
sympathy
for
the
downtrodden
As
much
as
the
Sand
Snakes
hate
the
Lannisters
and
wish
to
exact
revenge
they
and
Ellaria
Sand
have
no
personal
grudge
against
Myrcella
and
do
not
intend
to
harm
her
Tyene
Sand
has
a
plan
that
involves
Myrcella
according
to
Dornish
law
she
is
Joffreys
rightful
heir
because
in
Dorne
it
is
the
eldest
living
child
not
the
eldest
living
son
that
inherits
Since
Dornishmen
fight
best
at
home
she
suggests
her
uncle
to
crown
Myrcella
in
order
to
incite
the
Lannisters
and
the
Tyrells
into
attacking
Dorne
then
the
Dornish
shall
bleed
them
in
the
passes
and
bury
them
beneath
the
blowing
sands
Prince
Doran
says
grudgingly
he
will
think
about
that
After
Tyene
leaves
Doran
orders
to
arrest
her
and
the
other
Sand
Snakes
to
make
certain
they
will
not
push
Dorne
into
a
war
However
his
daughter
Arianne
attempts
to
carry
out
Tyenes
plan
and
seduces
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
for
that
purpose
Trystane
is
not
involved
in
the
plan
and
it
is
unknown
if
he
is
aware
of
it
While
Arianne
Myrcella
and
their
escorts
are
on
their
way
to
Hellholt
where
Arianne
intends
to
crown
Myrcella
they
are
intercepted
and
arrested
by
Areo
Hotah
During
the
confusion
moments
Ser
Gerold
Darkstar
Dayne
who
tried
to
persuade
Arianne
to
kill
Myrcella
rather
than
crowning
her
slashes
at
her
and
escapes
Luckily
her
horse
recoils
otherwise
she
would
have
lost
her
head
Maester
Caleotte
saves
her
life
but
no
treatment
can
restore
her
horribly
disfigured
face
she
loses
an
ear
and
has
a
hideous
facial
scar
Dayne
flees
from
Dorne
and
Doran
Martell
issues
a
manhunt
for
him
Her
death
in
the
television
series
however
implies
that
she
will
die
in
a
later
novel
Cersei
who
has
no
reason
to
suspect
Myrcella
is
in
danger
unlike
in
show
no
threat
is
sent
to
Cersei
from
Dorne
sends
Ser
Balon
Swann
of
the
Kingsguard
to
Dorne
to
bring
her
back
Doran
is
worried
that
the
Lannisters
will
hold
the
Martells
responsible
for
Myrcellas
injury
To
buy
time
he
sends
Myrcella
to
the
Water
Gardens
and
orders
his
bannermen
to
delay
Ser
Balon
by
holding
feasts
and
hunting
trips
for
him
Doran
consults
with
his
daughter
and
nieces
and
they
come
up
with
a
solution
Myrcella
instructed
by
Arianne
will
tell
Ser
Balon
that
Darkstar
tried
to
kill
her
lie
about
Ser
Arys
Oakhearts
part
in
the
incident
and
ask
him
to
capture
the
man
who
hurt
her
so
severely
As
Doran
predicts
Ser
Balon
believes
the
partlyfalse
story
and
is
unable
to
refuse
Myrcellas
request
After
sending
a
report
to
Kings
Landing
he
and
Obara
go
to
High
Hermitage
chasing
Darkstar
Cersei
is
shocked
and
saddened
to
hear
the
news
about
Myrcella
from
Kevan
She
has
no
idea
who
is
Darkstar
and
why
he
intended
to
harm
Myrcella
Recalling
how
Tyrion
was
disfigured
by
Ser
Mandon
Moore
at
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
she
claims
that
Tyrion
is
behind
the
attempt
on
her
daughters
life
and
Darkstar
is
his
catspaw
Currently
Myrcella
is
on
her
way
back
to
Kings
Landing
accompanied
by
Nymeria
Sand
Trystane
has
stayed
at
Sunspear
after
a
tearful
parting
from
her
While
Myrcella
might
have
suspected
that
Jaime
is
her
true
father
based
on
rumors
and
the
letters
Stannis
spread
all
over
Westeros
she
never
says
that
to
him
or
anyone
else
Besides
which
she
has
not
seen
Jaime
since
he
left
Kings
Landing
to
command
one
of
his
fathers
armies
in
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
He
never
goes
to
Dorne
to
try
and
rescue
her
Jaime
considers
revealing
to
Myrcella
that
he
is
her
father
but
fears
of
the
applications
he
thinks
Doran
Martell
has
betrothed
Myrcella
to
his
son
in
the
belief
that
she
was
Roberts
blood
and
revealing
the
truth
may
result
in
the
breaking
of
the
betrothal
Jaime
is
unaware
that
the
Martells
know
the
truth
about
Cerseis
children
based
on
Stanniss
letters
Previously
it
was
thought
that
Myrcellas
death
in
the
Season
finale
indicated
that
she
would
die
in
the
next
upcoming
novel
albeit
with
the
circumstances
moved
around
somewhat
Now
given
the
drastic
changes
to
the
Martell
storyline
in
Season
there
is
no
strong
reason
to
take
Myrcellas
death
in
the
TV
series
as
reflecting
that
she
will
in
fact
die
in
the
next
novel
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and
crew
Myrcella
is
pronounced
MerSELLuh
as
opposed
to
MERsulluh
that
is
it
doesnt
rhyme
with
Ursula
Myrcellas
age
in
the
TV
continuity
The
TV
series
never
directly
mentioned
Myrcellas
age
at
any
point
in
time
complicated
by
the
fact
that
she
didnt
appear
at
all
in
Seasons
and
and
the
role
was
recast
when
she
returned
in
Season
In
the
first
novel
Joffrey
is
twelve
Myrcella
is
eight
and
Tommen
is
seven
The
TV
series
agedup
many
younger
characters
by
two
years
pushing
the
beginning
of
Roberts
Rebellion
from
years
before
to
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
narrative
because
it
is
a
plot
point
that
characters
such
as
Daenerys
Targaryen
Robb
Stark
and
Jon
Snow
were
born
during
events
surrounding
the
war
The
TV
series
increased
Joffreys
age
however
not
by
two
years
but
by
four
years
so
that
he
was
actually
in
Season
actor
Jack
Gleeson
was
actually
years
old
in
Season
the
producers
cast
an
older
and
more
experienced
actor
due
to
the
narrative
weight
the
role
needed
to
carry
The
original
Myrcella
actress
Aimee
Richardson
assumed
that
the
character
was
around
years
old
in
Season
though
she
said
she
was
only
guessing
Because
Myrcella
is
the
middle
child
she
logically
couldnt
have
been
born
less
than
about
one
year
months
or
so
younger
than
Joffrey
and
Tommen
cant
be
less
than
one
year
or
so
younger
than
her
Following
the
general
principle
followed
in
the
TV
series
that
one
TV
season
equals
one
year
of
story
time
Joffrey
would
have
been
years
old
in
Season
so
Myrcella
couldnt
have
been
more
than
about
at
the
same
time
Meanwhile
the
TV
series
apparently
retconned
how
old
TVTommen
is
when
the
role
was
recast
in
Season
so
that
he
is
apparently
around
years
old
in
Season
he
has
to
be
above
the
legal
age
of
adulthood
in
Westeros
because
it
is
explicitly
stated
that
he
no
longer
has
a
regent
With
Tommens
age
pushed
up
to
around
in
Season
and
Joffreys
more
firmly
established
birth
date
meaning
he
would
have
been
in
Season
had
he
lived
the
only
possible
scenario
is
for
Myrcella
to
have
been
years
old
in
Season

The

series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is
filmed
at
frames
per
second
but
giants
are
filmed
at
frames
per
second
after
which
the
footage
is
played

at
the
regular

them
appear
slightly
slowerrefhttpwwwdenofgeekcomtvgameofthronesgameofthronesseasonwhatwelearnedfromtheblurays

The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are
even
larger
Other
techniques
were
that
the
giants
head
prosthetics
are
much
larger
than
the
actors
actual
heads
underneath
even
the

I
always
think
giants
in

look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and

So
the

Joe

The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for
each

HistoryEdit
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
Edit
While
visiting
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Edit
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the

forgotten

working
at

camp
While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
their
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
told
him
how
she
once
saw
a
giant
smash
a
man
straight
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
Season
Edit
Following
Jon
Snows
betrayal
and
flight
from
the
wildlings
he
reports
back
to
Castle
Blacks
remaining
leadership
that
Mance
Rayder
is
advancing
on
their
position
with
an
army
strong
and
that
he
has
united
the
Thenns
Hornfoots
and
the
Iceriver
clans
and
he
even
has
giants
marching
with
him
Janos
Slynt
breaks
out
laughing
as
south
of
the
Wall
giants
are
just
a
creature
from
stories
to
frighten
children
but
he
stops
when
he
sees
that
the
other
Nights
Watch
officers
such
as
Alliser
Thorne
and
Maester
Aemon
arent
laughing
but
are
apparently
willing
to
give
some
credence
to
Jon
if
he
says
he
saw
giants
with
his
own
eyes
During
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
several
giants
go
into
battle
against
the
Nights
Watch
along
with
the
Free
Folk
They
shoot
large
arrows
at
the
watchers
on
top
of
the
Wall
and
use
a
mammoth
to
try
and
break
down
the

to
get
into

tunnel
leading
to

but
is
killed
by

brothers
led
by
Grenn
As
the
night
ends
with
the
wildlings
momentarily
retreating
Jon
remarks
to
Samwell
Tarly
that
among
the
army
of
nearly
wildlings
that
Mance
has
amassed
there
might
be
hundreds
of
Giants
Season
Edit
At
Hardhome
Wun
Weg
Wun
Dar
Wun
is
the
only
known
giant
residing
in
the
wildling
settlement
Inside
the
large
keep
he
was
seen
looking
at
the
dragonglass
dagger
and
later
got
annoyed
when
Dolorous
Edd
stares
at
him
for
too
long
When
a
horde
of
wights
and
White
Walkers
under
theNight
King
attack
Wun
Wun
joined
in
the
defense
as
he
easily
defeats
many
wights
before
covering
the
escape
of
Jon
Snow
Tormund
and
the
few
remaining
defenders
with
a
burning
log
from
the
overwhelming
enemy
as
he
walks
into
the
sea
with
them
and
the
fleet
of
ships
boarded
by
wildling
refugees
Arriving
at
the
Wall
Wun
Wun
and
the
few
thousand
wildlings
were
allowed
safe
passage
to
settle
in
the
Gift
although
the
black
brothers
of
the
Nights
Watch
were
intimidated
at
the
sight
of
Wun
Wun
as
they
have
never
seen
a
giant
before
Season
Edit
When
Jon
Snow
is
later
assassinated
Wun
Wun
and
the
wildlings
are
summoned
back
to
Castle
Black
to
deal
with
the
mutineers
Wun
Wun
breaks
down
the
gate
at
Castle
Black
and
easily
intimidates
them
into
surrendering
killing
only
one
mutineer
after
he
foolishly
and
futilely
shot
the
giant
in
the
back
with
a
crossbow
He
later
agrees
to
help
a
resurrected
Jon
Snow
in
his
forthcoming
battle
against
Ramsay
Bolton
Wun
Wun
participates
in
the
battle
and
is
inundated
with
dozens
of
arrows
and
pierced
by
spears
He
falls
to
his
knees
before
being
shot
in
the
eye
by
Ramsay
after
breaching
Winterfell
It
is
unknown
whether
there
are
even
a
few
remaining
living
Giants
left
beyond
the
Wall
as
the
White
Walkers
are
seemingly
destroying
every
last
Free
Folk
stronghold
so
it
is
possible
that
with
Wun
Wuns
death
the
Giants
are
completely
extinct
Season
Edit
Surrounded
by
a
snowstorm
undead
giants
are
seen
within
the
massive

In
the
season
finale
two
large
wight
giants
are
seen
within
the
massive

of

Once
the

has
been

they
began
to
march
in
with
the
rest
of

Behind
the
scenesEdit
The
giant
costumes
are
actually
full
body
foam
suits
which
have
to
be
assembled
around
the
actors
By
the
end
of
Season
only
two
of
these
expensive
suits
have
been
produced
for
the
giants
Dongo
who
first
appeared
in
Season
played
by
Ian
Whyte
and
Mag
the
Mighty
played
by
Neil
Fingleton
Taller
people
and
creatures
physically
walk
with
a
different
gait
and
heft
than
smaller
ones
due
to
the
mechanics
of
their
extra
weight
simply
using
CGI
greenscreen
effects
to
make
an
averagesized
stuntman
appear
feet
tall
doesnt
realistically
capture
the
mechanics
of
how
a
giant
person
would
actually
move
The
TV
series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is
filmed
at
frames
per
second
but
giants
are
filmed
at
frames
per
second
after
which
the
footage
is
played
back
at
the
regular
frames
per
second
making
them
appear
slightly
slower
The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are
even
larger
Other
techniques
were
that
the
giants
head
prosthetics
are
much
larger
than
the
actors
actual
heads
underneath
even
the
giants
hands
seen
onscreen
are
actually
oversized
gloves
that
fit
over
the
already
very
large
stuntmens
hands
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humans

Creating
the
Mammoths
and
Giants
Joe
Bauer
VFX
Supervisor
The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for
each
of
our
giants
In
the
booksEdit
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
considered
to
be
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans
or
warband
leaders
A
particularly
large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent
ringleader
of
the
giants
in
Mance
Rayders
army
The
giants
inhabit
the
far
northern
regions
of
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
where
humans
will
not
encroach
on
them
perilously
close
to
the
Lands
of
Always
Winter
They
once
roamed
all
of
Westeros
but
were
pushed
further
and
further
north
when
the
First
Men
migrated
to
the
continent
starting
twelve
thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

History
Season
At
the
tomb
of
her
aunt
Lyanna
Stark
Petyr
Baelish
recalls
to
Sansa
Stark
how
Crown
Prince
Rhaegar
Targaryen
and
Lyanna
were
present
at
the
great
Tourney
of
Harrenhal
when
he
was
a
boy
Rhaegar
won
the
final
joust
of
the
tournament
and
the
entire
massive
crowd
cheered
only
to
suddenly
drop
dead
silent
as
Rhaegar
rode
past
his
wife
Elia
Martell
and
instead
placed
the
victors
crown
made
of
blue
winter
roses
onto
Lyannas
lap
Not
long
afterwards
Rhaegar
ran
off
with
Lyanna
sparking
off
Roberts
Rebellion
leading
to
the
deaths
of
thousands
and
the
fall
of
the
Targaryen
dynasty
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Lyanna
Stark
was
very
fond
of
blue
winter
roses
and
loved
their
scent
Eddard
often
thinks
of
them
in
association
with
Lyanna
Rhaegar
apparently
had
the
victors
crown
at
the
Tourney
of
Harrenhal
made
of
blue
winter
roses
in
advance
knowing
he
had
a
good
chance
of
winning
specifically
because
he
knew
that
Lyanna
liked
them
Even
the
statue
of
Lyanna
at

Making
the
Characters
who
are
dead
harder
to
see
On
the
front
page
of
the
Wiki
are
the
squares
that
have
been
highlited
red
over
the
characters
portarait
to
show
if
they
are
dead
or
not
This
was
a
major
spoiler
for
me
as
the
first
thing
I
saw
on
the
Wiki
was
the
death
of
a
major
character
Perhaps
these
squares
should
be
moved
to
a
movre
discreet
place
where
they
will
not
be
accidentaly
seen
Thank
you
Im
unsympathetic
to
viewers
who
start
watching
a
season
months
after
it
first
aired
go
online
to
read
about
it
and
then
find
plot
details
but
perhaps
we
could
be
more
welcoming
to
new
viewers
and
keep
the
front
screen
spoiler
free
What
do
our
other
editors
thinkOpark
April
UTC
I
agree
Opark
once
something
has
aired
its
no
longer
a
spoiler
This
wiki
is
after
all
intend
to
show
the
progress
of
the
tv
series

The

Dragons
Aegon
IIwhy
Also
given
that
they
havent
introduced
the
terms
blacks
and
greens
on
the
TV
show
just
yet
for
my
Rhaenyra
userbox
I
just
went
with
Rhaenyra
instead
of
the
blacks
so
more
people
would
know
what
I
meant
I
suggest
that
this
might
work
better
for
now
to
say
supported
Aegon
II
instead
of
Supported
the
greens

Because
even
ignoring
the
fact
that
Aegon
II
was
the
lawful
heir
Rhaenyra
was
mad
utterly
utterly
mad
and
in
the
short
amount
of
time
that
she
held
the
throne
for
proved
she
was
a
bad

Flags
Shields
and
Heraldry
Hey
just
noticed
you
created
a
lot
of
those
flags
I
have
been
seeing
around
Nice
Did
you
create
them
for
use
on
the
navboxes
I
have
mainly
been
editing
on
the
TellTale
pages
especially
the
family
trees
and
changed
the
navboxes
of
the
Forresters
and
Whitehills
back
to
the
heraldries
Those
flags
were
not
created
by
you
though
right
so
I
assumed
the
flags
were
just
for
the
location
articles
like
you
mention
on
your
user
page
However
I
noticed
your
flag
added
by
you
on
the
House
Umber
navbox
I
am
aware
that
these
were
created
and
added
over
a
year
ago
but
I
have
some
free
time
Should
your
flags
be
added
to
the
navboxes
They
would
need
to
be
made
smaller
to
px
in
the
source
editor
as
anything
bigger
really
breaks
the
format
of
the
navbox
as
shown
in
the
previous
Forrester
navbox
and
also
the
Umber
navbox
I
think
your
flags
look
way
better
and
neater
than
the
heraldries
though
so
maybe
its
a
good
idea
I
have
some
free
time
so
I
will
be
more
than
willing
to
add
them
to
all
the
navboxes
and
if
you
are
busy
I
dont
mind
making
some
missing
ones
either
should
this
plan
go
into
effect

Hi
there
Sorry
for
the
late
reply
and
thanks
The
flagsbanners
are
really
only
supposed
to
be
used
to
denote
locations
just
as
the
shields
are
for
characters
and
battles
Although
I
did
add
a
flag
to
the
Umber
navbox
and
a
few
others
I
think
Ive
realised
in
hindsight
that
it
doesnt
work
that
well
and
like
you
said
they
need
to
be
shrunk
down
in
order
to
fit
properly
without
breaking
the
layout
Im
currently
working
on
converting
the
main
heraldry
images
into
shield
format
same
as
A
Wiki
of
Ice
and
Fire
so
thats
probably
what
well
use
in
the
navbox
as
well
I
think
it
will
look
a
lot
better
and
some
pros
from
DeviantArt
are
helping
me
create
the
files
Hopefully
Ill
have
some
examples
up
later
this
evening
And
yes
help
with
this
project
would
be
very
welcome
indeedSer

Let
me
know
what
you
would
like
me
to
do
and
I
will
be
happy
to
help
I
am
not
a
professional
artist
like
you
presumably
and
also
Olyvar
who
has
been
doing
an
excellent
job
however
I
am
a
hobbyist
with
Photoshop
etc
so
just
let
me
know
a
checklist
and
Ill
give
it
a
gander
I
think
most
of
these
shield
style
heraldries
are
done
anyway
however
anything
at
all
Ill
be
happy
to
help
with
Also
I
assume
you
will
be
adding

heraldry

Whilst
you
are
at
it
please
add
Mossador

was
wondering
how
you
felt
about
using
this
shape
instead
of
the
current
one
Its
the
same
one
that
can
be
seen
in
the
White

so
is
more
canonical
but
also
helps
set
this
wiki
apart
from
the

rather
than
just
using
the
same
template

leave
it

Flags
Shields
and
Heraldry
Hey
just
noticed
you
created
a
lot
of
those
flags
I
have
been
seeing
around
Nice
Did
you
create
them
for
use
on
the
navboxes
I
have
mainly
been
editing
on
the
TellTale
pages
especially
the
family
trees
and
changed
the
navboxes
of
the
Forresters
and
Whitehills
back
to
the
heraldries
Those
flags
were
not
created
by
you
though
right
so
I
assumed
the
flags
were
just
for
the
location
articles
like
you
mention
on
your
user
page
However
I
noticed
your
flag
added
by
you
on
the
House
Umber
navbox
I
am
aware
that
these
were
created
and
added
over
a
year
ago
but
I
have
some
free
time
Should
your
flags
be
added
to
the
navboxes
They
would
need
to
be
made
smaller
to
px
in
the
source
editor
as
anything
bigger
really
breaks
the
format
of
the
navbox
as
shown
in
the
previous
Forrester
navbox
and
also
the
Umber
navbox
I
think
your
flags
look
way
better
and
neater
than
the
heraldries
though
so
maybe
its
a
good
idea
I
have
some
free
time
so
I
will
be
more
than
willing
to
add
them
to
all
the
navboxes
and
if
you
are
busy
I
dont
mind
making
some
missing
ones
either
should
this
plan
go
into
effect

Hi
there
Sorry
for
the
late
reply
and
thanks
The
flagsbanners
are
really
only
supposed
to
be
used
to
denote
locations
just
as
the
shields
are
for
characters
and
battles
Although
I
did
add
a
flag
to
the
Umber
navbox
and
a
few
others
I
think
Ive
realised
in
hindsight
that
it
doesnt
work
that
well
and
like
you
said
they
need
to
be
shrunk
down
in
order
to
fit
properly
without
breaking
the
layout
Im
currently
working
on
converting
the
main
heraldry
images
into
shield
format
same
as
A
Wiki
of
Ice
and
Fire
so
thats
probably
what
well
use
in
the
navbox
as
well
I
think
it
will
look
a
lot
better
and
some
pros

Of

Let
me
know
what
you
would
like
me
to
do
and
I
will
be
happy
to
help
I
am
not
a
professional
artist
like
you
presumably
and
also
Olyvar
who
has
been
doing
an
excellent
job
however
I
am
a
hobbyist
with
Photoshop
etc
so
just
let
me
know
a
checklist
and
Ill
give
it
a
gander
I
think
most
of
these
shield
style
heraldries
are
done
anyway
however
anything
at
all
Ill
be
happy
to
help
with
Also
I
assume
you
will
be
adding
the
Targaryen
heraldry
to
the
navbox
Whilst
you
are
at
it
please
add
Mossador
to
the
household
list
obviously
as
Mossador
beacuse
he
is
dead
Thanks
the

is
locked
so
I
cannot

Well
Im
a

proffessional
so
not
really
proffesional
just
a
serious
hobbyist
who
makes
a
bit
of
money
from
time
to
time
Im
definitley
not
a
digital
artist
anyway
Im
sure
Olly
would
appreciate
any
and
all
help
you
could
offer
Probably
best
to
liase
directly
with
him
as
he
knows
best
what
needs
to
be
done
And
sure
Ill
update
the

take

this

Hey
thats
brilliant
Yeah
thats
exactly
what
I
meant
I
hadnt
considered
adding
the
words
before
but
I
think
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
and
consistenecy
we
dont
know
all
the
house
words
after
all
we
should
leave
it
as
just
the
sigils
Also
can
I
get
you
to
name
all
the
files
HouseWhateverMainShieldPNG
Sorry
to
be
nitpicky
but
Lannister
shield
is
a
bit
generic
and
other

may
end
up
being
accidently
overwritten

Updates
Hi
there
just
a
quick
update
Ive
uploaded
the
family
tree
icons
for
houses
Bolton
and
Florent
so
maybe
you
could
update
those
when
you
have
a
moment
Also
when
the
time
comes
to
replace
the
character
shield
icons
I
was
wondering
how
you
felt
about
using
this
shape
instead
of
the
current
one
Its
the
same
one
that
can
be
seen
in
the
White
Book
so
is
more
canonical
but
also
helps
set
this
wiki
apart
from
the
Westerosorg
one
rather
than
just
using
the
same
template
Ill
leave
it
up
to
you
though

cool
I
really

For
example
most

also
to
add
Sansa

Since
technically
this

happen
Was
there
a
lot

trolling

Biography
Background
Season
Shae
holds
a
knife
to
the
throat
of
the
handmaid
in
A
Man
Without
Honor
She
is
a
handmaiden
to
Sansa
Stark
She
finds
Sansa
and
Shae
trying
to
turn
over
her
mattress
to
conceal
Sansas
first
flowering
She
attempts
to
inform
Queen
Cersei
but
Shae
threatens
her
with
a
knife
to
keep
quiet
Nevertheless
the
Queen
is
informed
by
Sandor
Clegane
Season
Bernadette
continues
to
be
assigned
to
Sansa
She
announces
Tyrion
Lannister
when
he
calls
on
Sansa
to
propose
to
her
Season
Bernadette
continues
to
spy
on
Tyrion
for
Cersei
and
discovers
that
his
real
secret
lover
is
actually
Shae
She
then
enters
Cerseis
chambers
while
Jaime
is
present
to
inform
her
of
something
important
Season
After
Sansas
departure
from
Kings
Landing
Bernadette
now
seems
to
be
serving
Cersei
herself
She
notifies
Cersei
that
a
ship
has
arrived
from
Dorne
Later
at
the
day
of
Cerseis
trial
by
the
Faith
she
helps
Cersei
into
her
clothes
moments
before
the
Destruction
of
the
Great
Sept
Season
Following
Cerseis
coronation
Bernadette
began
to
wear
dark
robes
and
cut
her
hair
short
as
the
court
fashion
for
women
was
now
mimicking
Cerseis
appearance
One
morning
Bernadette
went
to
the
Queens
room
to
inform
her
that
Tycho
Nestoris
was
waiting
for
her
While
there
Bernadette
spotted
a
naked
Jaime
in
the
bed
of
his
sister
as
Cersei
decided
that
they
would
no
longer
hide
their
incestuous
love
affair
Although
clearly
surprised
Bernadette
was
wise
enough
not
to
comment
and
to
simply
deal
with
Cerseis
instructions
right
away

Behind
the
scenes
There
is
no
character
named
Bernadette
in
the
novels
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
match
their
fantasy
world
The
character
is
never
actually
called
that
aloud
and
the
name
is
apparently
purely
from
the
filming
credits
This
name
was
probably
given
after
Bernadette
Caulfield
one
of
the
major
producers
on
the
TV
series
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
both
Sansa
and
Tyrion
are
aware
that
all
of
Sansas
maids
are
spies
for
Cersei
Thus
Sansa
is
careful
not
to
reveal
her
true
feelings
to
any
of
them
and
Tyrion
takes
precautions
when
he
meets
Shae
When
Tyrion
hears
servants
joke
about
him
that
he
still
has
not
had
sex
with
Sansa
he
figures
that
Sansas
maids
are
the
ones
who
spread
the
gossip
Tyrion
complains
to
his
father
about
Sansas
maids
being
women
in
Cerseis
service
Tywin
answers
nonchalantly
that
if
Tyrion
doesnt
like
his
wifes
servants
he
can
dismiss
them
and
hire
new
ones
Tyrion
does
so
hiring
Shae
who
unlike
in
the
series
is
utterly
indifferent
to
Sansa
and
another
woman
named
Brella
Sansa
feels
more
comfortable
around
them
but
is
still
careful

General
Author
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
the
storyline
in
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
is
partially
and
loosely
inspired
by
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
the
dynastic
conflict
that
occurred
in
England
intermittently
between
and
following
the
countrys
defeat
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
as
well
as
Maurice
Druons
novels
The
Accursed
Kings
about
the
history
of
the
French
Kings
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
Hundred
Years
War
Just
as
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
fought
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
the
conflict
in
Game
of
Thrones
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
The
technology
level
in
their
society
more
or
less
matches
late
medieval
Europe
ie
right
before
the
use
of
gunpowder
and
cannons
revolutionized
medieval
warfare
and
brought
it
into
the
Early
Modern
era
Magic
was
prevalent
in
the
world
in
the
longdistant
past
but
for
many
centuries
magical
power
has
dwindled
in
the
world
as
has
knowledge
of
its
use
While
a
handful
of
odd
cults
still
believe
in
magic
such
as
the
Alchemists
GuildandWarlocks
of
Qarth
they
can
do
little
to
substantiate
their
claims
The
general
population
considers
magic
to
have
never
existed
at
all
and
to
be
simply
mythical
a
view
promoted
by
the
Order
of
Maesters
who
champion
a
world
based
on
science
and
reason
and
scorn
the
very
idea
of
magic
The
mighty
Valyrian
Freehold
was
built
using
the
powerful
dragons
who
were
rumored
to
share
a
deep
link
with
magic
However
most
dragons
were
killed
in
the
Doom
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
before
the
narrative
of
Game
of
Thrones
begins
and
even
the
last
dragons
which
belonged
to
House
Targaryen
died
almost
two
centuries
ago
largely
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
Science
and
technology
have
not
significantly
advanced
in
the
past
several
centuries
Recorded
history
is
indeed
vastly
longer
in
the
fantasy
world
than
in
reallife
For
example
the
Valyrian
Freehold
existed
for
an
astonishing
five
thousand
years
before
its
fall
Written
history
in
Westeros
began
with
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
albeit
much
of
this
is
fragmentary
and
biased
see
main
article
Timeline
It
is
possible
that
in
earlier
ages
when
magic
was
more
prevalent
there
was
less
drive
to
innovate
new
tools
with
science
leaving
technology
levels
static
for
many
centuries
Even
so
while
the
general
rule
holds
that
gunpowder
has
not
been
discovered
there
is
not
a
oneforone
correspondence
between
the
technology
level
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
and
the
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
For
example
certain
medical
knowledge
is
much
more
advanced
and
accurate
in
Westeros
than
it
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
partially
because
certain
discoveries
in
history
have
been
accidental
ie
penicillin
not
the
culmination
of
a
long
aggregation
of
previous
discoveries
The
people
in
Westeros
and
beyond
are
also
capable
of
producing
vast
feats
of
architecture
such
as
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
without
the
use
of
magic
at
all
Martin
has
stated
that
medical
knowledge
is
officially
more
advanced
in
Westeros
than
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
I
made
a
deliberate
decision
when
the
books
began
to
have
the
maesters
and
have
Westeros
in
general
have
better
medical
knowledge
than
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
Mostly
because
I
didnt
want
everybody
dying
at
twentysix
So
it
is
generally
improved
the
maesters
have
improved
the
standard
of
hygiene
and
they
understand
certain
practices
and
they
can
do
things
better
Also
they
have
magic
While
this
might
seem
incongruent
with
the
otherwise
static
medieval
level
of
technology
in
Westeros
much
of
reallife
medical
knowledge
was
discovered
purely
through
trial
and
error
or
even
by
accident
such
as
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
The
maesters
might
not
know
the
underlying
theoretical
reasons
behind
illnesses
what
bacteria
and
viruses
are
but
they
have
accumulated
a
more
advanced
level
of
functional
medical
knowledge
for
practical
purposes
such
as
what
herb
mixtures
will
heal
infections
better
surgical
procedures
etc
Medicine

Armament
Military
technology
in
Westeros
and
Essos
is
loosely
comparable
to
the
kinds
used
during
the
reallife
Hundred
Years
War
and
War
of
the
Roses
Crossbows
are
prevalent
though
they
have
not
superseded
longbows
which
are
also
quite
common
on
the
battlefield
again
much
like
the
s
in
reallife
northwestern
Europe
Various
kinds
of
advanced
siege
weapons
such
as
catapults
are
employed
Horse
cavalry
are
widely
used
and
some
regions
of
Essos
are
known
to
use
mounted
elephants
Heavy
cavalry
using
mounted
knights
in
full
plate
armor
is
a
mainstay
of
the
battlefield
though
they
are
more
commonly
fielded
by
the
wealthier
regions
of
Westeros
ie
the
Reach
or
the
Westerlands
while
the
poorer
kingdoms
such
as
The
North
or
the
Iron
Islands
make
do
with
chain
mail
instead
of
full
plate
armor
Many
armies
frequently
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
mercenaries
Valyrian
steel
is
a
type
of
metal
forged
in
the
oncemighty
Valyrian
Freehold
used
to
make
swords
that
are
exceptionally
sharp
and
tremendously
strong
The
knowledge
of
how
to
create
Valyrian
steel
was
lost
in
the
fall
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
ago
making
the
few
surviving
Valyrian
steel
swords
incredibly
rare
and
expensive
Valyrian
steel
is
rumored
to
have
been
forged
with
the
aid
of
magic
spells
and
dragonfire
Gunpowder
does
not
exist
in
the
medieval
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
They
do
possess
Wildfire
a
highly
flammable
and
explosive
napalmlike
substance
the
Alchemists
Guild
refuses
to
divulge
how
wildfire
is
created
but
claim
that
it
is
done
with
magical
spells
a
claim
dismissed
by
others
particularly
the
maesters
Even
so
Wildfire
is
similar
to
real
life
Greek
fire
which
was
actually
used
by
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
medieval
times
and
thus
was
actually
a
technology
known
to
medieval
peoples
and
thus
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
for
a
medieval
setting
Dragons
were
of
course
used
in
warfare
but
they
are
more
of
a
magicbased
fantasy
creature
Moreover
the
last
known
dragons
in
the
world
died
out
two
hundred
years
ago
largely
due
to
many
of
them
being
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
in
which
dragons
were
used
to
kill
other
dragons
Thus
dragons
have
not
been
used
on
the
battlefield
in
two
centuries

Currency
Several
different
types
of
currency
are
used
in
the
worlds
various
economies
The
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros
have
a
uniform
system
of
coinage
based
on
the
Gold
Dragon
coin
The
different
cities
and
nations
across
the
Narrow
Sea
on
Essos
use
their
own
various
local
currencies
Books
and
writing
Different
societies
have
their
own
writing
systems
The
main
one
encountered
is
the
one
used
for
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
throughout
Westeros
The
Andals
introduced
the
first
full
writing
system
to
Westeros
the
First
Men
before
them
only
used
a
basic
rune
script
for
the
Old
Tongue
which
was
only
used
for
basic
inscriptions
on
grave
markers
etc
The
Dothraki
do
not
have
a
written
language
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
the
Valyrian
languages
in
the
Free
Cities
and
Slavers
Bay
have
their
own
glyphbased
writing
systems
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
represent
this
in
the
TV
series
The
novels
refer
to
characters
in
Westeros
using
both
parchment
made
from
animal
skins
and
paper
made
from
wood
pulp
This
is
not
incongruous
to
the
setting
paper
was
introduced
to
real
life
Western
Europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
though
it
did
not
surpass
use
of
parchment
for
many
centuries
Generally
parchment
was
still
used
for
important
documents
legal
charters
important
diplomatic
messages
etc
while
paper
was
a
cheap
less
durable
alternative
Given
that
Westeros
is
loosely
based
on
the
War
of
the
Roses
in
England
during
the
s
it
is
not
contradictory
that
their
society
uses
a
mix
of
paper
or
parchment
for
different
tasks
Paper
seems
to
be
often
used
for
more
common
tasks
the
messages
sent
via
the
raven
network
are
described
as
being
written
on
little
scrolls
of
paper
paper
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
parchment
so
it
is
probably
easier
to
roll
easier
to
fit
more
writing
on
each
roll
and
easier
for
the
birds
to
carry
More
important
handdelivered
messages
tend
to
be
written
on
parchment
particularly
royal
decrees
from
Kings
Landing
Most
if
not
all
books
are
made
out
of
parchment
not
paper
books
are
usually
commissioned
or
handcopied
and
thus
more
like
luxury
items
so
anyone
commissioning
one
will
have
it
made
of
high
quality
They
dont
have
cheap
massproduced
paper
books
No
mention
has
been
made
of
printing
press
technology
and
it
apparently
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
and
probably
not
in
Essos
either
The
printing
press
was
only
introduced
in
reallife
Medieval
Europe
in
the
mids
and
took
time
to
be
implemented
again
matching
the
general
historical
period
of
the
setting
It
is
unknown
if
other
societies
use
earlier
forms
of
printing
such
as
woodblock
printing
etc

Measurement
Measurements
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
are
given
in
imperial
measurements
As
they
are
a
medieval
society
their
systems
of
measurements
weights
and
coinage
grew
haphazardly
out
of
local
customs
instead
of
any
rational
basis
For
example
the
Wall
is
miles
long
and
feet
tall
converted
to
the
metric
system
for
the
benefit
of
some
viewers
the
Wall
is
kilometers
long
and
between
and
meters
tall
Weights
are
rarely
mentioned
in
the
TV
series
but
it
has
been
said
that
pounds
tons
and
ounces
are
used
to
measure
them
These
are
also
nonmetric
units
as
kilograms
do
not
exist
as
a
unit
in
Westeros
in
the
books
the
old
nonmetric
unit
of
stones
is
also
used
one
stone
equals
about
pounds
Smaller
distances
can
be
measured
in
yards
Animals
and
Plants
See
main
article
Animals
and
Plants
Several
notable
animal
and
plant
species
exist
in
Westeros
and
the
Known
World
Some
of
these
have
no
real
world
counterparts
but
many
are
based
on
ice
age
megafauna
which
did
exist
in
reallife
but
went
extinct
thousands
of
years
ago
On
the
whole
it
is
very
unusual
to
encounter
animals
that
are
significantly
different
than
encountered
in
reallife
medieval
Europe
and
the
Near
East
A
few
animals
have
no
oneforone
counterpart
with
real
life
ones
ie
shadowcats
are
common
animals
somewhere
in
size
between
a
cougar
and
a
tiger
but
not
exactly
like
either
In
general
however
even
direwolves
are
a
very
rare
and
unusual
animal
for
the
inhabitants
of
Westeros
to
encounter
in
keeping
with
George
RR
Martins
attempts
to
create
a
more
realistic
gritty
fantasy
world
Animals
Dragons
winged
reptiles
of
tremendous
age
and
ferocity
capable
of
breathing
fire
Originated
in
the
east
and
enslaved
by
the
Valyrians
who
used
them
to
forge
their
empire
Most
dragons
were
destroyed
in
the
Doom
four
centuries
ago
leaving
the
few
possessed
by
House
Targaryen
as
the
only
surviving
dragons
in
the
world
which
they
used
in
their
invasion
of
Westeros
The
last
Targaryen
dragons
died
over
years
ago
The
skulls
of
more
than
a
dozen
dragons
are
kept
in
the
Red
Keep
Direwolves
a
larger
cousin
of
regular
wolves
only
found
north
of
the
Wall
In
the
south
they
are
considered
nearmythical
Occasional
sightings
of
direwolves
have
been
reported
by
the
Nights
Watch
but
at
the
time
the
series
starts
there
have
been
no
confirmed
sightings
south
of
the
Wall
for
centuries
Horses
A
common
animal
bred
all
over
Westeros
commonly
used
as
methods
of
transport
Krakens
massive
cephalopods
that
stalk
the
worlds
oceans
So
rare
that
they
are
largely
held
to
be
mythical
though
sailors
occasionally
report
seeing
them

they

Does

because
some

Well
if
Ive
understood
you
correctly
Im
pretty

just
because

The

is

It
is

Mormont
Contentsshow
Synopsis
Jorah
Mormont
details
the
cultures
and
customs
of
each
of
the
nine
Free
Cities
of
Essos
Narration
Jorah
Mormont
At
its
height
the
Valyrian
Freehold
ruled
over
half
the
Known
World
Not
bad
for
former
shepherds
but
the
Doom
fell
on
them
and
sent
their
capital
into
the
sea
Now
Volantis
is
the
ember
of
Old
Valyria
ensuring
its
flame
does
not
go
out
of
this
world
as
any
Volantene
will
tell
you
Pentoshi
say
the
same
about
Pentos
Lysenes
about
Lys
and
so
on
But
after
enough
time
in
the
nine
Free
Cities
is
hard
to
see
them
as
anything
but
ashes
of
glory
Volantis
is
the
oldest
the
first
colony
of
Valyria
After
the
Doom
the
Volantenes
tried
to
rebuild
the
empire
under
their
rule
They
failed
Not
least
because
the
last
Valyrian
with
dragons
Aegon
Targaryen
entered
the
war
against
them
Now
Volantenes
are
content
with
dominating
only
the
lower
classes
Or
so
they
say
Braavos
is
the
strangest
a
city
erected
not
by
the
Freehold
but
against
it
A
labyrinth
of
illusion
and
deceit
to
hide
the
refugees
from
Valyrian
slave
lords
After
the
Doom
the
city
emerged
from
the
shadows
to
become
one
of
the
greatest
banking
centers
in
the
world
A
man
can
get
anything
in
Braavos
for
a
price
Especially
death
Your
own
if
one
offends
one
of
the
swaggering
swordsmen
that
pollute
the
city
Or
if
youre
very
rich
or
very
desperate
anyone
elses
Lys
is
the
easiest
of
the
Free
Cities
full
of
pleasure
houses
catering
to
every
taste
no
matter
how
peculiar
Many
men
lose
themselves
in
Lys
and
are
never
found
at
least
alive
When
a
man
runs
out
of
coin
the
Lysenes
may
grant
him
their
other
speciality
on
the
house
poison
Pentos
is
the
most
ruthless
The
Magisters
make
a
great
show
of
choosing
the
Prince
of
Pentos
from
the
Great
Families
and
granting
him
the
powers
of
trade

As
long
as
he
checks
with
them
first
On
the
Mew
Year
to
bring
good
fortune
to
Pentos
this
Prince
must
deflower
the
Maid
of
the
Field
and
the
Maid
of
the
Seas
I
confess
I
dont
know
how
each
is
chosen
or
what
becomes
of
them
after
serving
their
purpose
But
if
a
crop
should
fail
or
a
war
be
lost
the
Magisters
will
slit
the
Princes
throat
and
choose
another
The
other
Free
Cities
are
known
for
what
they
make
Myr
has
its
lenses

finery
Norvos
its

Qohor
its

can
reforge
Valyrian

Tyrosh

Im
sure
Lorath
adds
something
to
the
world
but
I
cant
think
of
it
Frankly
the
nine
of
them
are
more
alike
than
than
they
would
care
to
admit
They
hire
the
same
soldiers
to
fight
the
same
wars
for
the
same
rulers
the
rich
be
they
called
Magisters
Archons
or
what
have
you
When
a
Dothraki
khalasar
approaches
they
give
the
same
tribute
to
avoid
the
same
sacking
For
thousands
of
years
the
disgraced
of
Westeros
have
rained
east
to
pool
in
the
Free
Cities
for
a
man
of
honor
counts
for
less
than
nothing
unless
it
raises
his
price
Better
men
than
I
have
learned
that
what
a
man
sells
for
gold
he
can
never
buy
back
He
must
earn
it
by
fire

blood

A
walk
of
atonement
is
a
public
ritual
of
punishment
and
penance
in
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
It
demands
a
confessed
sinner
to
walk
a
certain
distance
stripped
of
all
clothing
exposed
to
the
eyes
and
jeers
of
the
population

History
Season
Cersei
prepares
for
her
Walk
of
atonement
After
being
caught
at
a
brothel
in
the
middle
of
a
session
of
blasphemous
sexual
roleplay
the
High
Septon
is
trapped
by
a
group
of
Sparrows
stripped
of
all
his
clothes
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
while
one
of
the
Sparrows
publicly
names
him
a
sinner
and
beats
his
hands
to
keep
him
from
covering
his
genitalia
Cersei
endures
her
punishment
After
a
time
imprisoned
by
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
Queen
Cersei
confesses
to
having
committed
adultery
with
her
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
who
had
joined
the
Faith
Militant
and
accused
her
of
adultery
incest
and
regicide
The
High
Sparrow
informs
Cersei
that
she
will
still
be
tried
for
the
other
two
charges
that
she
denies
while
allowing
her
to
return
to
the
Red
Keep
only
if
she
performs
a
walk
of
atonement
as
penance
for
her
confessed
sin
Cerseis
hair
is
cut
short
and
then
she
is
presented
to
the
population
of
Kings
Landing
so
they
will
bear
witness
to
her
confession
and
penitence
She
is
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
made
to
walk
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
to
the
Red
Keep
escorted
by
members
of
the
Faith
Militant
who
keep
away
the
leering
and
jeering
crowds
who
have
gathered
to
see
her
shame
and
take
the
chance
to
insult
their
hated
Queen
Mother
As
she
walks
Septa
Unella
accompanies
her
repeatedly
crying
out
Shame
and
ringing
a
bell
to
attract
peoples
attention
Season
At
a
Small
Council
meeting
Cersei
informs
Olenna
Tyrell
that
Margaery
will
perform
a
similar
walk
of
atonement
before
the
day
of
the
trial
and
they
both
agree
this
cannot
happen
Margaery
is
ultimately
spared
from
her
walk
when
King
Tommen
Baratheon
agrees
to
an
alliance
with
the
High
Sparrow
When
Jaime
Lannister
is
formally
removed
from
the
Kingsguard
for
threatening
the
Faith
he
sarcastically
asks
if
he
will
be
forced
to
take
a
walk
of
atonement
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
it
seems
walks
of
atonement
are
civil
punishments
reserved
to
publicly
shame
women
accused
of
adultery
or
whoring
It
also
serves
as
a
means
of
degrading
these
women
and
stripping
them
of
whatever
pride
or
power
they
might
hold
The
novels
mention
only
two
people
who
had
to
go
through
this
humiliating
punishment
Tytos
Lannisters
mistress
and
Cersei
Tywin
Lannister
forced
his
fathers
mistress
into
a
walk
of
atonement
after
Lord
Tytos
died
While
it
is
common
for
widowed
lords
to
take
lowborn
women
as
bedwarmers
Tytoss
mistress
a
woman
scarcely
one
step
above
a
whore
had
come
to
dominate
him
utterly
being
seated
beside
him
in
the
hall
showered
with
gifts
and
honors
even
being
asked
her
views
on
matters
of
state
She
came
to
steal
from
him
order
the
household
knights
about
dismiss
servants
and
help
herself
to
the
jewelry
of
the
late
Lady
Jeyne
Tytoss
wife
She
grew
so
influential
that
it
was
said
about
Lannisport
that
any
man
who
wished
for
his
petition
to
be
heard
should
kneel
before
her
and
speak
loudly
to
her
lap
for
Lord
Tytoss
ear
was
between
his
ladys
legs
Lord
Tytos
died
of
a
heart
attack
while
climbing
stairs
to
see
her
The
first
thing
Tywin
did
on
his
return
from
Kings
Landing
was
to
expel
the
mistress
from
Casterly
Rock
All
the
selfseekers
who
had
named
themselves
her
friends
and
cultivated
her
favor
abandoned
her
The
silks
and
velvets
Tytos
had
lavished
on
her
and
the
jewelry
she
had
taken
for
herself
was
stripped
from
her
Tywin
had
her
stripped
and
sent
forth
naked
to
walk
through
the
streets
of
Lannisport
to
the
docks
for
a
fortnight
telling
everyone
she
met
in
the
way
she
was
a
thief
and
a
whore
Though
no
man
laid
a
hand
on
her
that
walk
spelled
the
end
of
her
power
Cersei
was
too
young
to
witness
the
spectacle
herself
but
heard
the
stories
from
washerwomen
and
guardsmen
who
had
been
there
Although
Kevan
has
disapproved
of
Cerseis
deeds
especially
her
incestuous
affair
with
Jaime
corrupting
Lancel
spoiling
Joffrey
and
her
poor
conduct
as
the
Queen
Regent
he
does
not
gloat
at
Cersei
but
feels
sorry
for
her
public
humiliation
He
muses
sadly
that
Tywin
would
have
never
dreamed
that
the
same
degrading
punishment
he
gave
their
fathers
mistress
would
be
imposed
on
his
own
daughter
In
the
novels
when
Cersei
is
shorn
the
septas
remove
all
of
her
body
hair
her
eyebrows
pubic
hair
even
scraping
the
rest
of
her
body
They
shave
her
head
completely
bald
In
the
TV
episode
the
septas
prominently
produce
a
razor
blade
as
if
they
are
going
to
shave
her
but
curiously
does
not
use
it
at
all
One
septa
separately
picks
up
a
pair
of
shears
and
cuts
her
luxurious
long
golden
hair
off
but
crops
it
close
to
her
head
instead
of
shaving
her
bald
entirely
In
her
subsequent
nude
scenes
the
rest
of
her
body
hair
isnt
shaved
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
Cerseis
walk
of
atonement
is
loosely
based
on
what
happened
to
Jane
Shore
the
mistress
of
King
Edward
IV
of
England
who
like
Robert
Baratheon
was
a
great
warrior
who
won
the
crown
on
the
battlefield
in
his
youth
but
became
fat
and
illsuited
to
rule
in
later
life
After
Edward
IV
died
his
brother
Richard
III
usurped
the
throne
ahead
of
his
nephews
He
deeply
resented
Jane
so
he
had
her
arrested
and
made
her
perform
a
penance
walk
a
common
punishment
for
harlotry
Jane
Shore
did
not
perform
the
penance
walk
naked
however
but
had
to
walk
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
London
wearing
only
her
kirtle
petticoat
which
given
the
times
was
still
said
to
have
gained
significant
male
attention
the
main
source
of
the
humiliation
was
that
this
was
a
punishment
normally
meted
out
to
harlots
Martin
has
said
that
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
one
of
the
major
inspirations
for
his
novels
the
conflict
was
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
while
in
Westeros
the
conflict
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
clearly
named
after
the
real
families

In
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
is
summoned
by
the
dosh
khaleen
to
eat
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
crones
can
read
the
omens
At
first
it
seems
she
wont
hold
the
raw
meat
down
but
to
both
her
and
Drogos
relief
she
is
able
to
compose
herself
The

declare
Daenerys

son
will
be
The
Stallion
That
Mounts
The
World
a
great
conqueror
whose
coming
is
long
foretold
in
Dothraki
history
Daenerys
says
his
name
will
be
Rhaego
for
her
brother
Rhaegar
slain
by
the
usurper
Robert
Baratheon
In
the
books
In
the
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
dosh
khaleen
have
great
honor
and
status
amongst
the
Dothraki
At
their
bidding
no
blood
may
be
spilled
or
blade
bared
within
the
confines
of
Vaes
Dothrak
though
this
does
not
prevent
other
inventive
forms
of
killing
Daenerys
as
the
wife
of
Khal
Drogo
is
told
that
when
Drogo
dies
she
will
be
expected
to
return
to
Vaes
Dothrak
and
join
the
dosh
khaleen

other
than
the
current
monarch
particularly
during
a
regency
when
the
ruler
is
underaged
though
if
the
current
ruler
does
not
possess
great
martial
skill
he
may
simply
choose
to
delegate
the
office
to
someone
else
Some
rulers
have
combined
the
two
aforementioned
titles
and
have
instead
held
the
title
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Known
cases
of
this
include
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
and
Queen
Daenerys
Targaryen
The
crown
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
the
first
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
The
office
of
the
ruler
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
often
referred
to
as
the
Iron
Throne
in
reference
to
the
eponymous
throne
on
which
the
King
holds
court
The
position
was
created
when
Aegon
the
Conqueror
succeeded
in
his
conquest
of
Westeros
unifying
the
independent
kingdoms
of
the
Isles
and
Rivers
the
Rock
the
Reach
the
Mountain
and
Vale
the
Stormlands
and
the
Kingdom
of
the
North
The
Principality
of
Dorne
was
later
united
to
the
realm
through
marriagealliance
Upon
her
ascension
to
the
Iron
Throne
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
was
named
the
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
by
Qyburn
This
title
combines
the
ranks
of
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
and
was
created
by
Cersei
The
King
or
Queen
is
formally
addressed
by
his
subjects
as
Your
Grace
and
in
official
events
referred
to
employing
the
following
structure
Name
of
the
House
Name
the
ordinal
number
of
HisHer
Name
KingQueen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
LordLady
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
For
example
Robert
Baratheon
is
formally
referred
to
as
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon
the
first
of
His
name
etc
If
a
king
has
not
yet
reached
the
legal
age
of
majority
however
a
Regent
will
be
named
to
rule
until
he
comes
of
age
King
of
Westeros
The
entire
continent
of
Westeros
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
colored
white
The
lands
beyond
the
Wall
colored
red
are
not
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
but
are
still
part
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
King
of
Westeros
and
this
term
does
not
officially
exist
within
the
Game
of
Thrones
TV
series
Westeros
is
the
entire
continent
stretching
far
north
to
the
lands
Beyond
the
Wall
which
are
unmapped
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
the
large
unified
realm
which
covers
most
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
but
which
stops
at
the
Wall
After
the
Targaryen
Conquest
the
term
Seven
Kingdoms
became
a
geographical
term
referring
to
how
Westeros
south
of
the
Wall
used
to
be
divided
into
seven
independent
kingdoms
On
several
occasions
dialogue
in
the
TV
series
has
referred
to
the
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
as
the
King
of
Westeros
but
this
is
not
an
official
term
in
the
novels
Stannis
has
been
referred
to
as
this
a
few
times
in
the
novels
but
it
is
apparently
a
colloquialism
not
the
formal
title
For
that
matter
the
term
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
technically
exist
either
the
proper
title
is
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
At
the
least
however
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
lay
claim
to
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
In
the
books
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
full
title
used
is
actually
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
Its
probable
that
the
Rhoynar
was
omitted
in
Season
for
the
sake
of
not
confusing
viewers
who
havent
read
the
books
with
too
much
information
because
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
wouldnt
be
introduced
until
Season
Corroborating
this
very
few
references
were
made
about
Dorne
at
all
before
Season
compared
to
the
earlier
novels
which
referred
to
it
and
House
Martell
often
the
TV
series
held
off
on
giving
this
much
long
exposition
until
Oberyn
Martell
was
physically
introduced
onscreen
in
Season
though
on
the
other
hand
Season
didnt
actually
explain
who
the
First
Men
or
the
Andals
were
in
onscreen
dialogue
either
only
in
supplementary
materials
When
Season
did
eventually
air
however
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
continued
to
be
used
Even
during
King
Tommen
Baratheons
coronation
scene
in
First
of
His
Name
with
Prince
Oberyn
Martell
standing
prominently
among
the
nobles
assembled
in
front
of
the
Iron
Throne
Tommen
is
still
crowned
using
only
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
excluding
the
Rhoynar
even
though
as
a
Dornishman
Oberyn
is
himself
descended
from
the
Rhoynar
However
in
the
season
finale
Daenerys
is
presented
using
the
full
title
It
would
appear
that
the
TV
series
initially
chose
to
continue
using
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
because
it
is
what
they
had
been
using
for
three
seasons
and
they
wished
to
remain
internally
consistent
the
other
option
was
to
suddenly
start
using
the
full
title
without
explanation
introducing
a
rather
large
retcon
that
this
is
what
they
should
have
been
saying
all
along
This
isnt
necessarily
an
inexplicable
situation
within
the
TVcontinuity
itself
Dorne
was
actually
independent
from
the
Targaryen
realm
for
two
centuries
and
when
they
entered
united
with
the
Iron
Throne
they
were
allowed
special
privileges
such
as
maintaining
their
own
equal
primogeniture
system
and
even
styling
their
ruling
family
as
Princes
of
Dorne
not
Lord
Paramount
of
Dorne
Thus
it
is
possible
that
in
the
TV
continuity
the
Targaryen
kings
simply
never
referred
to
themselves
as
Kings
of
the
Rhoynar
as
well
even
after
the
marriagealliance
but
still
as
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
Dorne
is
still
ruled
by
its
own
Princes
even
if
it
is
now
subject
to
the
Iron
Throne
further
acknowledging
that
Dorne
is
essentially
a
semiautonomous
region
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
It
might
have
been
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
marriagealliance
in
the
TV
continuity
As
explained
in
the
article
for
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
all
of
the
Targaryen
kings
starting
with
Aegon
I
himself
styled
themselves
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
despite
the
fact
that
Dorne
remained
independent
Aegon
I
had
declared
himself
king
of
all
of
Westeros
just
before
his
army
even
landed
on
the
continent
Dorne
included
While
Dorne
had
been
able
to
resist
his
armies
and
dragons
through
guerrilla
warfare
Aegon
himself
never
acknowledged
that
this
was
a
permanent
state
of
affairs
Aegon
and
all
of
his
heirs
considered
themselves
the
de
jure
kings
of
the
Rhoynar
and
of
Dorne
even
if
they
had
no
de
facto
control
over
it
comparable
to
how
medieval
English
kings
would
at
times
hold
titles
of
lordship
over
Wales
Ireland
and
France
despite
not
controlling
all
or
even
most
of
these
territories
At
no
point
as
readers
sometimes
have
assumed
did
Aegon
ever
promote
the
Riverlands
into
being
considered
the
seventh
kingdom
the
Riverlands
were
occupied
by
the
Iron
Islands
when
he
invaded
and
not
an
independent
kingdom
instead
making
up
the
eighth
kingdom
of
sorts
Dorne
was
always
the
seventh
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
the
Targaryens
just
refused
to
ever
officially
acknowledge
that
they
did
not
actually
control
it
in
the
novels
continuity
In
the
TV
continuity
therefore
the
Targaryen
kings
may
have
just
acknowledged
for
the
first
two
centuries
of
their
dynasty
that
they
didnt
actually
rule
the
Rhoynar
people
in
Dorne
and
that
one
of
the
special
privileges
of
Dorne
uniting
with
the
Iron
Throne
through
marriagealliance
one
century
ago
is
that
the
Targaryens
didnt
suddenly
add
King
of
the
Rhoynar
to
their
title
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
in
episode
The
Children
even
though
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
just
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
four
episodes
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
One
notable
exception
to
this
occurred
however
when
the
TV
series
was
not
internally
consistent
and
used
the
original
full
title
from
the
novels
including
mention
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
Season
finale
The
Children
when
Missandei
introduces
Daenerys
Targaryen
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Moreover
she
was
speaking
in
Low
Valyrian
at
the
time
so
her
lines
were
actually
written
in
onscreen
subtitles
This
was
not
even
consistent
use
for
Missandei
and
Daenerys
within
Season
itself
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
only
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
again
with
onscreen
subtitles
so
this
wasnt
just
a
mistake
by
the
actress
but
in
the
script
In
the
middle
of
Season
as
already
noted
no
mention
was
made
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
title
even
at
Tommens
coronation
in
episode
when
Oberyn
Martell
was
standing
in
front
of
the
audience
No
official
word
has
come
down
to
make
sense
of
this
but
it
appears
to
simply
be
a
mistake
by
the
scriptwriters
ie
they
accidentally
wrote
the
full
bookversion
of
the
title
and
forgot
their
own
change
to
the
continuity
This
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
a
comment
George
RR
Martin
himself
made
It
is
true
that
the
Targaryen
succession
on
the
series
is
different
than
the
one
in
the
novels
most
notably
the
Mad
Kings
father
Jaehaerys
II
was
dropped
as
was
established
way
back
in
season
one
In
much
the
same
way
as
the
Rhoynar
have
been
dropped
from
the
royal
titles
King
of
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
etc
This
strongly
implies
that
there
was
an
actual
sitdown
meeting
of
the
writers
back
in
Season
when
they
formally
established
the
principle
that
the
title
in
the
TV
continuity
was
officially
going
to
be
shortened
to
just
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
and
as
a
scriptwriter
in
Season
Martin
was
aware
of
this
The
title
was
also
consistently
given
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
throughout
Season
omitting
the
Rhoynar
The
single
use
of
the
full
book
version
of
the
title
in
the
Season
finale
therefore
simply
appears
to
be
a
script
error
and
not
canonical
In
the
Season
premiere
however
Daenerys
once
again
switched
back
to
introducing
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
without
explanation
At
this
point
it
is
again
unclear
what
the
title
is
officially
supposed
to
be
in
the
TV
continuity
The
TV
writers
could
have
retained
the
original
version
which
omitted
of
the
Rhoynar
or
they
could
have
initiated
a
retcon
by
adding
in
of
the
Rhoynar
from
Season
onwards
instead
they
inconsistently
flipflopped
between
the
two
forms
It
is
possible
that
the
two
terms
are
simply
interchangeable
Ruling
Queens
In
the
three
hundred
years
between
the
Targaryen
Conquest
and
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
there
has
never
been
a
Ruling
Queen
a
female
heir
of
the
current
monarch
inheriting
power
in
her
own
right
The
first
four
Targaryen
kings
all
had
male
heirs
who
were
also
their
eldest
child
However
the
fifth
Targaryen
king
Viserys
I
only
had
one
surviving
child
by
his
first
wife
before
she
died
a
daughter
named
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
With
no
other
heirs
Viserys
I
and
his
court
raised
Rhaenyra
with
the
expectation
that
she
would
be
the
first
Ruling
Queen
However
Viserys
I
remarried
late
in
life
and
had
several
sons
with
his
second
wife
the
eldest
of
which
was
his
son
Aegon
II
When
Viserys
I
died
this
sparked
a
succession
war
between
Rhaenyra
and
Aegon
II
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
which
raged
from
to
AL
about
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Aegon
II
ultimately
had
Rhaenyra
fed
alive
to
his
dragon
but
her
supporters
continued
to
fight
in
the
name
of
her
children
and
not
long
afterwards
Aegon
II
himself
died
childless
As
the
only
remaining
heir
of
Viserys
I
or
Aegon
II
Rhaenyras
own
son
Aegon
III
inherited
the
throne
Aegon
IIIs
own
sons
both
died
childless
and
ultimately
Rhaenyras
younger
son
Viserys
II
succeeded
to
the
throne
After
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons
the
Targaryens
revised
the
official
royal
succession
laws
to
follow
an
extreme
form
of
malepreference
primogeniture
placing
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
ones
ie
if
all
of
a
kings
sons
died
childless
his
own
younger
brothers
would
inherit
instead
of
his
daughters
their
nieces
Such
was
the
case
when
after
both
of
Aegon
IIIs
sons
died
childless
his
daughter
Daena
was
skipped
over
in
succession
for
Aegon
IIIs
younger
brother
Viserys
II
These
altered
inheritance
laws
ensured
that
there
was
no
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Many
historians
point
to
the
succession
of
Rhaenyras
son
Aegon
III
after
Aegon
II
died
as
proof
of
the
legitimacy
of
Rhaenyras
claim
to
inheritance
in
the
civil
war
and
while
she
lived
she
did
personally
use
the
title
of
Ruling
Queen
Officially
however
Rhaenyra
is
considered
a
rival
claimant
and
is
not
counted
in
the
formal
line
of
succession
Any
possible
future
Ruling
Queen
by
the
name
of
Rhaenyra
would
be
titled
Rhaenyra
I
not
Rhaenyra
II
As
this
would
lead
to
controversy
over
whether
to
acknowledge
Rhaenyras
claim
during
the
Dance
of
Dragons
subsequent
generations
of
the
Targaryen
family
simply
avoided
the
issue
by
never
naming
any
subsequent
daughters
Rhaenyra
At
the
end
of
season
where
King
Tommen
Baratheon
commits
suicide
after
the
destruction
of
the
Sept
of
Baelor
Cersei
Lannister
has
proclaimed
and
coronated
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Cersei
considers
herself
the
first
true
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
Westeros
but
then
again
so
did
Rhaenyra
future
historians
in
Westeros
will
decide
if
shes
just
another
rival
claimant
Cersei
claimed
the
Iron
Throne
without
any
legal
grounds
whatsoever
apparently
just
right
of
conquest

Titles
The
title
refers
to
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
the
two
largest
ethnic
groups
on
the
continent
The
King
or
Queen
simultaneously
possesses
the
title
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
which
refers
to
the
seven
independent
kingdoms
that
existed
prior
to
their
unification
in
the
Targaryen
Conquest
The
ruler
usually
also
holds
the
title
and
office
of
Protector
of
the
Realm
the
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
led
by
the
four
Wardens
The
office
of
Protector
of
the
Realm
is
sometimes
given
to
someone
other
than
the
current
monarch
particularly
during
a
regency
when
the
ruler
is
underaged
though
if
the
current
ruler
does
not
possess
great
martial
skill
he
may
simply
choose
to
delegate
the
office
to
someone
else
Some
rulers
have
combined
the
two
aforementioned
titles
and
have
instead
held
the
title
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Known
cases
of
this
include
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
and
Queen
Daenerys
Targaryen
The
crown
of
Aegon

Conqueror
the
first
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
The
office
of
the
ruler
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
often
referred
to
as
the
Iron
Throne
in
reference
to
the
eponymous
throne
on
which
the
King
holds
court
The
position
was
created
when
Aegon
the
Conqueror
succeeded
in
his
conquest
of
Westeros
unifying
the
independent
kingdoms
of
the
Isles
and
Rivers
the
Rock
the
Reach
the
Mountain
and
Vale
the
Stormlands
and
the
Kingdom
of
the
North
The
Principality
of
Dorne
was
later
united
to
the
realm
through
marriagealliance
Upon
her
ascension
to
the
Iron
Throne
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
was
named
the
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
by
Qyburn
This
title
combines
the
ranks
of
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
and
was
created
by
Cersei
The
King
or
Queen
is
formally
addressed
by
his
subjects
as
Your
Grace
and
in
official
events
referred
to
employing
the
following
structure
Name

the
House
Name

ordinal
number
of
HisHer
Name
KingQueen
of
the
Andals
and
the

LordLady
of
the
Seven

and
Protector

For
example
Robert
Baratheon
is
formally
referred
to
as
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon
the
first
of
His
name
etc
If
a
king
has
not
yet
reached
the
legal
age
of
majority
however
a
Regent
will
be
named
to

until
he
comes

The

Westeros
The
Seven

are

The
lands
beyond
the
Wall
colored
red
are
not
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
but
are
still
part
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
King
of
Westeros
and
this
term
does
not
officially
exist
within
the
Game
of
Thrones
TV
series
Westeros
is
the
entire
continent
stretching
far
north
to
the
lands
Beyond
the
Wall
which
are
unmapped
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
the
large
unified
realm
which
covers
most
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
but
which
stops
at
the
Wall
After
the
Targaryen
Conquest
the
term
Seven
Kingdoms
became
a
geographical
term
referring
to
how
Westeros
south
of
the
Wall
used
to
be
divided
into
seven
independent
kingdoms
On
several
occasions
dialogue
in
the
TV
series
has
referred
to
the
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
as
the
King
of
Westeros
but
this
is
not
an
official
term
in
the
novels
Stannis
has
been
referred
to
as
this
a
few
times
in
the
novels
but
it
is
apparently
a
colloquialism
not
the
formal
title
For
that
matter
the
term
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
technically
exist
either
the
proper
title
is
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
At
the
least
however
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
lay
claim
to
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
In
the
books
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
full
title
used
is
actually
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
Its
probable
that
the
Rhoynar
was
omitted
in
Season
for
the
sake
of
not
confusing
viewers
who
havent
read
the
books
with
too
much
information
because
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
wouldnt
be
introduced
until
Season
Corroborating
this
very
few
references
were
made
about
Dorne
at
all
before
Season
compared
to
the
earlier
novels
which
referred
to
it
and
House
Martell
often
the
TV
series
held
off
on
giving
this
much
long
exposition
until
Oberyn
Martell
was
physically
introduced
onscreen
in
Season
though
on
the
other
hand
Season
didnt
actually
explain
who
the
First
Men
or
the
Andals
were
in
onscreen
dialogue
either
only
in
supplementary
materials
When
Season
did
eventually
air
however
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
continued
to
be
used
Even
during
King
Tommen
Baratheons
coronation
scene
in
First
of
His
Name
with
Prince
Oberyn
Martell
standing
prominently
among
the
nobles
assembled
in
front
of
the
Iron
Throne
Tommen
is
still
crowned
using
only
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
excluding
the
Rhoynar
even
though
as
a
Dornishman
Oberyn
is
himself
descended
from
the
Rhoynar
However
in
the
season
finale
Daenerys
is
presented
using
the
full
title
It
would
appear
that
the
TV
series
initially
chose
to
continue
using
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
because
it
is
what
they
had
been
using
for
three
seasons
and
they
wished
to
remain
internally
consistent
the
other
option
was
to
suddenly
start
using
the
full
title
without
explanation
introducing
a
rather
large
retcon
that
this
is
what
they
should
have
been
saying
all
along
This
isnt
necessarily
an
inexplicable
situation
within
the
TVcontinuity
itself
Dorne
was
actually
independent
from
the
Targaryen
realm
for
two
centuries
and
when
they
entered
united
with
the
Iron
Throne
they
were
allowed
special
privileges
such
as
maintaining
their
own
equal
primogeniture
system
and
even
styling
their
ruling
family
as
Princes
of
Dorne
not
Lord
Paramount
of
Dorne
Thus
it
is
possible
that
in
the
TV
continuity
the
Targaryen
kings
simply
never
referred
to
themselves
as
Kings
of
the
Rhoynar
as
well
even
after
the
marriagealliance
but
still
as
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
Dorne
is
still
ruled
by
its
own
Princes
even
if
it
is
now
subject
to
the
Iron
Throne
further
acknowledging
that
Dorne
is
essentially
a
semiautonomous
region
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
It
might
have
been
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
marriagealliance
in
the
TV
continuity
As
explained
in
the
article
for
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
all
of
the
Targaryen
kings
starting
with
Aegon
I
himself
styled
themselves
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
despite
the
fact
that
Dorne
remained
independent
Aegon
I
had
declared
himself
king
of
all
of
Westeros
just
before
his
army
even
landed
on
the
continent
Dorne
included
While
Dorne
had
been
able
to
resist
his
armies
and
dragons
through
guerrilla
warfare
Aegon
himself
never
acknowledged
that
this
was
a
permanent
state
of
affairs
Aegon
and
all
of
his
heirs
considered
themselves
the
de
jure
kings
of
the
Rhoynar
and
of
Dorne
even
if
they
had
no
de
facto
control
over
it
comparable
to
how
medieval
English
kings
would
at
times
hold
titles
of
lordship
over
Wales
Ireland
and
France
despite
not
controlling
all
or
even
most
of
these
territories
At
no
point
as
readers
sometimes
have
assumed
did
Aegon
ever
promote
the
Riverlands
into
being
considered
the
seventh
kingdom
the
Riverlands
were
occupied
by
the
Iron
Islands
when
he
invaded
and
not
an
independent
kingdom
instead
making
up
the
eighth
kingdom
of
sorts
Dorne
was
always
the
seventh
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
the
Targaryens
just
refused
to
ever
officially
acknowledge
that
they
did
not
actually
control
it
in
the
novels
continuity
In
the
TV
continuity
therefore
the
Targaryen
kings
may
have
just
acknowledged
for
the
first
two
centuries
of
their
dynasty
that
they
didnt
actually
rule
the
Rhoynar
people
in
Dorne
and
that
one
of
the
special
privileges
of
Dorne
uniting
with
the
Iron
Throne
through
marriagealliance
one
century
ago
is
that
the
Targaryens
didnt
suddenly
add
King
of
the
Rhoynar
to
their
title
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
in
episode
The
Children
even
though
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
just
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
four
episodes
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
One
notable
exception
to
this
occurred
however
when
the
TV
series
was
not
internally
consistent
and
used
the
original
full
title
from
the
novels
including
mention
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
Season
finale
The
Children
when
Missandei
introduces
Daenerys
Targaryen
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Moreover
she
was
speaking
in
Low
Valyrian
at
the
time
so
her
lines
were
actually
written
in
onscreen
subtitles
This
was
not
even
consistent
use
for
Missandei
and
Daenerys
within
Season
itself
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
only
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
again
with
onscreen
subtitles
so
this
wasnt
just
a
mistake
by
the
actress
but
in
the
script
In
the
middle
of
Season
as
already
noted
no
mention
was
made
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
title
even
at
Tommens
coronation
in
episode
when
Oberyn
Martell
was
standing
in
front
of
the
audience
No
official
word
has
come
down
to
make
sense
of
this
but
it
appears
to
simply
be
a
mistake
by
the
scriptwriters
ie
they
accidentally
wrote
the
full
bookversion
of
the
title
and
forgot
their
own
change
to
the
continuity
This
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
a
comment
George
RR
Martin
himself
made
It
is
true
that
the
Targaryen
succession
on
the
series
is
different
than
the
one
in
the
novels
most
notably
the
Mad
Kings
father
Jaehaerys
II
was
dropped
as
was
established
way
back
in
season
one
In
much
the
same
way
as
the
Rhoynar
have
been
dropped
from
the
royal
titles
King
of
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
etc
This
strongly
implies
that
there
was
an
actual
sitdown
meeting
of
the
writers
back
in
Season
when
they
formally
established
the
principle
that
the
title
in
the
TV
continuity
was
officially
going
to
be
shortened
to
just
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
and
as
a
scriptwriter
in
Season
Martin
was
aware
of
this
The
title
was
also
consistently
given
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
throughout
Season
omitting
the
Rhoynar
The
single
use
of
the
full
book
version
of
the
title
in
the
Season
finale
therefore
simply
appears
to
be
a
script
error
and
not
canonical
In
the
Season
premiere
however
Daenerys
once
again
switched
back
to
introducing
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
without
explanation
At
this
point
it
is
again
unclear
what
the
title
is
officially
supposed
to
be
in
the
TV
continuity
The
TV
writers
could
have
retained
the
original
version
which
omitted
of
the
Rhoynar
or
they
could
have
initiated
a
retcon
by
adding
in
of
the
Rhoynar
from
Season
onwards
instead
they
inconsistently
flipflopped
between
the
two
forms
It
is
possible
that
the
two
terms
are
simply
interchangeable
Ruling
Queens
In
the
three
hundred
years
between
the
Targaryen
Conquest
and
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
there
has
never
been
a
Ruling
Queen
a
female
heir
of
the
current
monarch
inheriting
power
in
her
own
right
The
first
four
Targaryen
kings
all
had
male
heirs
who
were
also
their
eldest
child
However
the
fifth
Targaryen
king
Viserys
I
only
had
one
surviving
child
by
his
first
wife
before
she
died
a
daughter
named
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
With
no
other
heirs
Viserys
I
and
his
court
raised
Rhaenyra
with
the
expectation
that
she
would
be
the
first
Ruling
Queen
However
Viserys
I
remarried
late
in
life
and
had
several
sons
with
his
second
wife
the
eldest
of
which
was
his
son
Aegon
II
When
Viserys
I
died
this
sparked
a
succession
war
between
Rhaenyra
and
Aegon
II
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
which
raged
from
to
AL
about
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Aegon
II
ultimately
had
Rhaenyra
fed
alive
to
his
dragon
but
her
supporters
continued
to
fight
in
the
name
of
her
children
and
not
long
afterwards
Aegon
II
himself
died
childless
As
the
only
remaining
heir
of
Viserys
I
or
Aegon
II
Rhaenyras
own
son
Aegon
III
inherited
the
throne
Aegon
IIIs
own
sons
both
died
childless
and
ultimately
Rhaenyras
younger
son
Viserys
II
succeeded
to
the
throne
After
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons
the
Targaryens
revised
the
official
royal
succession
laws
to
follow
an
extreme
form
of
malepreference
primogeniture
placing
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
ones
ie
if
all
of
a
kings
sons
died
childless
his
own
younger
brothers
would
inherit
instead
of
his
daughters
their
nieces
Such
was
the
case
when
after
both
of
Aegon
IIIs
sons
died
childless
his
daughter
Daena
was
skipped
over
in
succession
for
Aegon
IIIs
younger
brother
Viserys
II
These
altered
inheritance
laws
ensured
that
there
was
no
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Many
historians
point
to
the
succession
of
Rhaenyras
son
Aegon
III
after
Aegon
II
died
as
proof
of
the
legitimacy
of
Rhaenyras
claim
to
inheritance
in
the
civil
war
and
while
she
lived
she
did
personally
use
the
title
of
Ruling
Queen
Officially
however
Rhaenyra
is
considered
a
rival
claimant
and
is
not
counted
in
the
formal
line
of
succession
Any
possible
future
Ruling
Queen
by
the
name
of
Rhaenyra
would
be
titled
Rhaenyra
I
not
Rhaenyra
II
As
this
would
lead
to
controversy
over
whether
to
acknowledge
Rhaenyras
claim
during
the
Dance
of
Dragons
subsequent
generations
of
the
Targaryen
family
simply
avoided
the
issue
by
never
naming
any
subsequent
daughters
Rhaenyra
At
the
end
of
season
where
King
Tommen
Baratheon
commits
suicide
after
the
destruction
of
the
Sept
of
Baelor
Cersei
Lannister
has
proclaimed
and
coronated
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Cersei
considers
herself
the
first
true
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
Westeros
but
then
again
so
did
Rhaenyra
future
historians
in
Westeros
will
decide
if
shes
just
another
rival
claimant
Cersei
claimed
the
Iron
Throne
without
any
legal
grounds
whatsoever
apparently
just
right
of
conquest

The
title
refers
to
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
the
two
largest
ethnic
groups
on
the
continent
The
King
or
Queen
simultaneously
possesses
the
title
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
which
refers
to
the
seven
independent
kingdoms
that
existed
prior
to
their
unification
in
the
Targaryen
Conquest
The
ruler
usually
also
holds
the
title
and
office
of
Protector
of
the
Realm
the
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
led
by
the
four

The
office
of
Protector

is
sometimes
given
to
someone
other

the
current

during
a

great
martial
skill
he
may

Some
rulers
have
combined
the
two
aforementioned
titles
and
have
instead
held
the
title
Protector

The
office
of
the
ruler
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
often
referred
to
as
the
Iron
Throne
in
reference
to
the
eponymous
throne
on
which
the
King
holds
court
The
position
was
created
when
Aegon
the
Conqueror
succeeded
in
his
conquest
of
Westeros
unifying
the
independent
kingdoms
of
the
Isles
and
Rivers
the
Rock
the
Reach
the
Mountain

the
Stormlands
and
the
Kingdom

The
Principality

Dorne
was
later
united
to
the

Upon
her
ascension
to
the
Iron
Throne
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
was
named
the
Protector

by
Qyburn
This
title
combines
the
ranks
of
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
and
was
created
by
Cersei
The

His
name
etc
If
a
king
has
not
yet
reached
the
legal
age
of
majority
however
a
Regent
will
be
named
to
rule
until
he
comes
of
age
King
of
Westeros
The
entire
continent
of
Westeros
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
colored
white
The
lands
beyond
the
Wall
colored
red
are
not
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
but
are
still
part
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
King
of
Westeros
and
this
term
does
not
officially
exist
within
the
Game
of
Thrones
TV
series
Westeros
is
the
entire
continent
stretching
far
north
to
the
lands
Beyond
the
Wall
which
are
unmapped
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
the
large
unified
realm
which
covers
most
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
but
which
stops
at
the
Wall
After
the
Targaryen
Conquest
the
term
Seven
Kingdoms
became
a
geographical
term
referring
to
how
Westeros
south
of
the
Wall
used
to
be
divided
into
seven
independent
kingdoms
On
several
occasions
dialogue
in
the
TV
series
has
referred
to
the
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
as
the
King
of
Westeros
but
this
is
not
an
official
term
in
the
novels
Stannis
has
been
referred
to
as
this
a
few
times
in
the
novels
but
it
is
apparently
a
colloquialism
not
the
formal
title
For
that
matter
the
term
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
technically
exist
either
the
proper
title
is
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
At
the
least
however
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
lay
claim
to
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
In
the
books
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
full
title
used
is
actually
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
Its
probable
that
the
Rhoynar
was
omitted
in
Season
for
the
sake
of
not
confusing
viewers
who
havent
read
the
books
with
too
much
information
because
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
wouldnt
be
introduced
until
Season
Corroborating
this
very
few
references
were
made
about
Dorne
at
all
before
Season
compared
to
the
earlier
novels
which
referred
to
it
and
House
Martell
often
the
TV
series
held
off
on
giving
this
much
long
exposition
until
Oberyn
Martell
was
physically
introduced
onscreen
in
Season
though
on
the
other
hand
Season
didnt
actually
explain
who
the
First
Men
or
the
Andals
were
in
onscreen
dialogue
either
only
in
supplementary
materials
When
Season
did
eventually
air
however
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
continued
to
be
used
Even
during
King
Tommen
Baratheons
coronation
scene
in
First
of
His
Name
with
Prince
Oberyn
Martell
standing
prominently
among
the
nobles
assembled
in
front
of
the
Iron
Throne
Tommen
is
still
crowned
using
only
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
excluding
the
Rhoynar
even
though
as
a
Dornishman
Oberyn
is
himself
descended
from
the
Rhoynar
However
in
the
season
finale
Daenerys
is
presented
using
the
full
title
It
would
appear
that
the
TV
series
initially
chose
to
continue
using
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
because
it
is
what
they
had
been
using
for
three
seasons
and
they
wished
to
remain
internally
consistent
the
other
option
was
to
suddenly
start
using
the
full
title
without
explanation
introducing
a
rather
large
retcon
that
this
is
what
they
should
have
been
saying
all
along
This
isnt
necessarily
an
inexplicable
situation
within
the
TVcontinuity
itself
Dorne
was
actually
independent
from
the
Targaryen
realm
for
two
centuries
and
when
they
entered
united
with
the
Iron
Throne
they
were
allowed
special
privileges
such
as
maintaining
their
own
equal
primogeniture
system
and
even
styling
their
ruling
family
as
Princes
of
Dorne
not
Lord
Paramount
of
Dorne
Thus
it
is
possible
that
in
the
TV
continuity
the
Targaryen
kings
simply
never
referred
to
themselves
as
Kings
of
the
Rhoynar
as
well
even
after
the
marriagealliance
but
still
as
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
Dorne
is
still
ruled
by
its
own
Princes
even
if
it
is
now
subject
to
the
Iron
Throne
further
acknowledging
that
Dorne
is
essentially
a
semiautonomous
region
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
It
might
have
been
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
marriagealliance
in
the
TV
continuity
As
explained
in
the
article
for
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
all
of
the
Targaryen
kings
starting
with
Aegon
I
himself
styled
themselves
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
despite
the
fact
that
Dorne
remained
independent
Aegon
I
had
declared
himself
king
of
all
of
Westeros
just
before
his
army
even
landed
on
the
continent
Dorne
included
While
Dorne
had
been
able
to
resist
his
armies
and
dragons
through
guerrilla
warfare
Aegon
himself
never
acknowledged
that
this
was
a
permanent
state
of
affairs
Aegon
and
all
of
his
heirs
considered
themselves
the
de
jure
kings
of
the
Rhoynar
and
of
Dorne
even
if
they
had
no
de
facto
control
over
it
comparable
to
how
medieval
English
kings
would
at
times
hold
titles
of
lordship
over
Wales
Ireland
and
France
despite
not
controlling
all
or
even
most
of
these
territories
At
no
point
as
readers
sometimes
have
assumed
did
Aegon
ever
promote
the
Riverlands
into
being
considered
the
seventh
kingdom
the
Riverlands
were
occupied
by
the
Iron
Islands
when
he
invaded
and
not
an
independent
kingdom
instead
making
up
the
eighth
kingdom
of
sorts
Dorne
was
always
the
seventh
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
the
Targaryens
just
refused
to
ever
officially
acknowledge
that
they
did
not
actually
control
it
in
the
novels
continuity
In
the
TV
continuity
therefore
the
Targaryen
kings
may
have
just
acknowledged
for
the
first
two
centuries
of
their
dynasty
that
they
didnt
actually
rule
the
Rhoynar
people
in
Dorne
and
that
one
of
the
special
privileges
of
Dorne
uniting
with
the
Iron
Throne
through
marriagealliance
one
century
ago
is
that
the
Targaryens
didnt
suddenly
add
King
of
the
Rhoynar
to
their
title
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
in
episode
The
Children
even
though
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
just
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
four
episodes
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
One
notable
exception
to
this
occurred
however
when
the
TV
series
was
not
internally
consistent
and
used
the
original
full
title
from
the
novels
including
mention
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
Season
finale
The
Children
when
Missandei
introduces
Daenerys
Targaryen
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Moreover
she
was
speaking
in
Low
Valyrian
at
the
time
so
her
lines
were
actually
written
in
onscreen
subtitles
This
was
not
even
consistent
use
for
Missandei
and
Daenerys
within
Season
itself
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
only
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
again
with
onscreen
subtitles
so
this
wasnt
just
a
mistake
by
the
actress
but
in
the
script
In
the
middle
of
Season
as
already
noted
no
mention
was
made
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
title
even
at
Tommens
coronation
in
episode
when
Oberyn
Martell
was
standing
in
front
of
the
audience
No
official
word
has
come
down
to
make
sense
of
this
but
it
appears
to
simply
be
a
mistake
by
the
scriptwriters
ie
they
accidentally
wrote
the
full
bookversion
of
the
title
and
forgot
their
own
change
to
the
continuity
This
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
a
comment
George
RR
Martin
himself
made
It
is
true
that
the
Targaryen
succession
on
the
series
is
different
than
the
one
in
the
novels
most
notably
the
Mad
Kings
father
Jaehaerys
II
was
dropped
as
was
established
way
back
in
season
one
In
much
the
same
way
as
the
Rhoynar
have
been
dropped
from
the
royal
titles
King
of
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
etc
This
strongly
implies
that
there
was
an
actual
sitdown
meeting
of
the
writers
back
in
Season
when
they
formally
established
the
principle
that
the
title
in
the
TV
continuity
was
officially
going
to
be
shortened
to
just
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
and
as
a
scriptwriter
in
Season
Martin
was
aware
of
this
The
title
was
also
consistently
given
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
throughout
Season
omitting
the
Rhoynar
The
single
use
of
the
full
book
version
of
the
title
in
the
Season
finale
therefore
simply
appears
to
be
a
script
error
and
not
canonical
In
the
Season
premiere
however
Daenerys
once
again
switched
back
to
introducing
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
without
explanation
At
this
point
it
is
again
unclear
what
the
title
is
officially
supposed
to
be
in
the
TV
continuity
The
TV
writers
could
have
retained
the
original
version
which
omitted
of
the
Rhoynar
or
they
could
have
initiated
a
retcon
by
adding
in
of
the
Rhoynar
from
Season
onwards
instead
they
inconsistently
flipflopped
between
the
two
forms
It
is
possible
that
the
two
terms
are
simply
interchangeable
Ruling
Queens
In
the
three
hundred
years
between
the
Targaryen
Conquest
and
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
there
has
never
been
a
Ruling
Queen
a
female
heir
of
the
current
monarch
inheriting
power
in
her
own
right
The
first
four
Targaryen
kings
all
had
male
heirs
who
were
also
their
eldest
child
However
the
fifth
Targaryen
king
Viserys
I
only
had
one
surviving
child
by
his
first
wife
before
she
died
a
daughter
named
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
With
no
other
heirs
Viserys
I
and
his
court
raised
Rhaenyra
with
the
expectation
that
she
would
be
the
first
Ruling
Queen
However
Viserys
I
remarried
late
in
life
and
had
several
sons
with
his
second
wife
the
eldest
of
which
was
his
son
Aegon
II
When
Viserys
I
died
this
sparked
a
succession
war
between
Rhaenyra
and
Aegon
II
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
which
raged
from
to
AL
about
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Aegon
II
ultimately
had
Rhaenyra
fed
alive
to
his
dragon
but
her
supporters
continued
to
fight
in
the
name
of
her
children
and
not
long
afterwards
Aegon
II
himself
died
childless
As
the
only
remaining
heir
of
Viserys
I
or
Aegon
II
Rhaenyras
own
son
Aegon
III
inherited
the
throne
Aegon
IIIs
own
sons
both
died
childless
and
ultimately
Rhaenyras
younger
son
Viserys
II
succeeded
to
the
throne
After
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons
the
Targaryens
revised
the
official
royal
succession
laws
to
follow
an
extreme
form
of
malepreference
primogeniture
placing
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
ones
ie
if
all
of
a
kings
sons
died
childless
his
own
younger
brothers
would
inherit
instead
of
his
daughters
their
nieces
Such
was
the
case
when
after
both
of
Aegon
IIIs
sons
died
childless
his
daughter
Daena
was
skipped
over
in
succession
for
Aegon
IIIs
younger
brother
Viserys
II
These
altered
inheritance
laws
ensured
that
there
was
no
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Many
historians
point
to
the
succession
of
Rhaenyras
son
Aegon
III
after
Aegon
II
died
as
proof
of
the
legitimacy
of
Rhaenyras
claim
to
inheritance
in
the
civil
war
and
while
she
lived
she
did
personally
use
the
title
of
Ruling
Queen
Officially
however
Rhaenyra
is
considered
a
rival
claimant
and
is
not
counted
in
the
formal
line
of
succession
Any
possible
future
Ruling
Queen
by
the
name
of
Rhaenyra
would
be
titled
Rhaenyra
I
not
Rhaenyra
II
As
this
would
lead
to
controversy
over
whether
to
acknowledge
Rhaenyras
claim
during
the
Dance
of
Dragons
subsequent
generations
of
the
Targaryen
family
simply
avoided
the
issue
by
never
naming
any
subsequent
daughters
Rhaenyra
At
the
end
of
season
where
King
Tommen
Baratheon
commits
suicide
after
the
destruction
of
the
Sept
of
Baelor
Cersei
Lannister
has
proclaimed
and
coronated
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Cersei
considers
herself
the
first
true
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
Westeros
but
then
again
so
did
Rhaenyra
future
historians
in
Westeros
will
decide
if
shes
just
another
rival
claimant
Cersei
claimed
the
Iron
Throne
without
any
legal
grounds
whatsoever
apparently
just
right
of
conquest

Titles
The
title
refers
to
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
the
two
largest
ethnic
groups
on
the
continent
The
King
or
Queen
simultaneously
possesses
the
title
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
which
refers
to
the
seven
independent
kingdoms
that
existed
prior
to
their
unification
in
the
Targaryen
Conquest
The
ruler
usually
also
holds
the
title
and
office
of
Protector
of
the
Realm
the
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
led
by
the
four
Wardens
The
office
of
Protector
of
the
Realm
is
sometimes
given
to
someone
other
than
the
current
monarch
particularly
during
a
regency
when
the
ruler
is
underaged
though
if
the
current
ruler
does
not
possess
great
martial
skill
he
may
simply
choose
to
delegate
the
office
to
someone
else
Some
rulers
have
combined
the
two
aforementioned
titles
and
have
instead
held
the
title
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Known
cases
of
this
include
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
and
Queen
Daenerys
Targaryen
The
crown
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
the
first
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
The
office
of
the
ruler
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
often
referred
to
as
the
Iron
Throne
in
reference
to
the
eponymous
throne
on
which
the
King
holds
court
The
position
was
created
when
Aegon
the
Conqueror
succeeded
in
his
conquest
of
Westeros
unifying
the
independent
kingdoms
of
the
Isles
and
Rivers
the
Rock
the
Reach
the
Mountain
and
Vale
the
Stormlands
and
the
Kingdom
of
the
North
The
Principality
of
Dorne
was
later
united
to
the
realm
through
marriagealliance
Upon
her
ascension
to
the
Iron
Throne
Queen
Cersei
Lannister
was
named
the
Protector
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
by
Qyburn
This
title
combines
the
ranks
of
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
and
was
created
by
Cersei
The
King
or
Queen
is
formally
addressed
by
his
subjects
as
Your
Grace
and
in
official
events
referred
to
employing
the
following
structure
Name
of
the
House
Name
the
ordinal
number
of
HisHer
Name
KingQueen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First

LordLady
of
the
Seven

and
Protector

For
example
Robert
Baratheon
is
formally
referred
to
as
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon
the
first
of
His
name
etc
If
a
king
has
not
yet
reached
the
legal
age
of
majority
however
a
Regent
will
be
named
to
rule
until
he
comes
of
age
King
of
Westeros
The
entire
continent
of
Westeros
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
colored
white
The
lands
beyond
the
Wall
colored
red
are
not
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
but
are
still
part
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
King
of
Westeros
and
this
term
does
not
officially
exist
within
the
Game
of
Thrones
TV
series
Westeros
is
the
entire
continent
stretching
far
north
to
the
lands
Beyond
the
Wall
which
are
unmapped
The
Seven
Kingdoms
are
the
large
unified
realm
which
covers
most
of
the
continent
of
Westeros
but
which
stops
at
the
Wall
After
the
Targaryen
Conquest
the
term
Seven
Kingdoms
became
a
geographical
term
referring
to
how
Westeros
south
of
the
Wall
used
to
be
divided
into
seven
independent
kingdoms
On
several
occasions
dialogue
in
the
TV
series
has
referred
to
the
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
as
the
King
of
Westeros
but
this
is
not
an
official
term
in
the
novels
Stannis
has
been
referred
to
as
this
a
few
times
in
the
novels
but
it
is
apparently
a
colloquialism
not
the
formal
title
For
that
matter
the
term
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
technically
exist
either
the
proper
title
is
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
At
the
least
however
King
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
doesnt
lay
claim
to
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
In
the
books
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
full
title
used
is
actually
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
Its
probable
that
the
Rhoynar
was
omitted
in
Season
for
the
sake
of
not
confusing
viewers
who
havent
read
the
books
with
too
much
information
because
Dorne
and
the
Rhoynar
wouldnt
be
introduced
until
Season
Corroborating
this
very
few
references
were
made
about
Dorne
at
all
before
Season
compared
to
the
earlier
novels
which
referred
to
it
and
House
Martell
often
the
TV
series
held
off
on
giving
this
much
long
exposition
until
Oberyn
Martell
was
physically
introduced
onscreen
in
Season
though
on
the
other
hand
Season
didnt
actually
explain
who
the
First
Men
or
the
Andals
were
in
onscreen
dialogue
either
only
in
supplementary
materials
When
Season
did
eventually
air
however
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
continued
to
be
used
Even
during
King
Tommen
Baratheons
coronation
scene
in
First
of
His
Name
with
Prince
Oberyn
Martell
standing
prominently
among
the
nobles
assembled
in
front
of
the
Iron
Throne
Tommen
is
still
crowned
using
only
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
excluding
the
Rhoynar
even
though
as
a
Dornishman
Oberyn
is
himself
descended
from
the
Rhoynar
However
in
the
season
finale
Daenerys
is
presented
using
the
full
title
It
would
appear
that
the
TV
series
initially
chose
to
continue
using
the
shortened
title
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
because
it
is
what
they
had
been
using
for
three
seasons
and
they
wished
to
remain
internally
consistent
the
other
option
was
to
suddenly
start
using
the
full
title
without
explanation
introducing
a
rather
large
retcon
that
this
is
what
they
should
have
been
saying
all
along
This
isnt
necessarily
an
inexplicable
situation
within
the
TVcontinuity
itself
Dorne
was
actually
independent
from
the
Targaryen
realm
for
two
centuries
and
when
they
entered
united
with
the
Iron
Throne
they
were
allowed
special
privileges
such
as
maintaining
their
own
equal
primogeniture
system
and
even
styling
their
ruling
family
as
Princes
of
Dorne
not
Lord
Paramount
of
Dorne
Thus
it
is
possible
that
in
the
TV
continuity
the
Targaryen
kings
simply
never
referred
to
themselves
as
Kings
of
the
Rhoynar
as
well
even
after
the
marriagealliance
but
still
as
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
Dorne
is
still
ruled
by
its
own
Princes
even
if
it
is
now
subject
to
the
Iron
Throne
further
acknowledging
that
Dorne
is
essentially
a
semiautonomous
region
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
It
might
have
been
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
marriagealliance
in
the
TV
continuity
As
explained
in
the
article
for
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
all
of
the
Targaryen
kings
starting
with
Aegon
I
himself
styled
themselves
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
despite
the
fact
that
Dorne
remained
independent
Aegon
I
had
declared
himself
king
of
all
of
Westeros
just
before
his
army
even
landed
on
the
continent
Dorne
included
While
Dorne
had
been
able
to
resist
his
armies
and
dragons
through
guerrilla
warfare
Aegon
himself
never
acknowledged
that
this
was
a
permanent
state
of
affairs
Aegon
and
all
of
his
heirs
considered
themselves
the
de
jure
kings
of
the
Rhoynar
and
of
Dorne
even
if
they
had
no
de
facto
control
over
it
comparable
to
how
medieval
English
kings
would
at
times
hold
titles
of
lordship
over
Wales
Ireland
and
France
despite
not
controlling
all
or
even
most
of
these
territories
At
no
point
as
readers
sometimes
have
assumed
did
Aegon
ever
promote
the
Riverlands
into
being
considered
the
seventh
kingdom
the
Riverlands
were
occupied
by
the
Iron
Islands
when
he
invaded
and
not
an
independent
kingdom
instead
making
up
the
eighth
kingdom
of
sorts
Dorne
was
always
the
seventh
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
the
Targaryens
just
refused
to
ever
officially
acknowledge
that
they
did
not
actually
control
it
in
the
novels
continuity
In
the
TV
continuity
therefore
the
Targaryen
kings
may
have
just
acknowledged
for
the
first
two
centuries
of
their
dynasty
that
they
didnt
actually
rule
the
Rhoynar
people
in
Dorne
and
that
one
of
the
special
privileges
of
Dorne
uniting
with
the
Iron
Throne
through
marriagealliance
one
century
ago
is
that
the
Targaryens
didnt
suddenly
add
King
of
the
Rhoynar
to
their
title
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
in
episode
The
Children
even
though
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
just
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
four
episodes
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
One
notable
exception
to
this
occurred
however
when
the
TV
series
was
not
internally
consistent
and
used
the
original
full
title
from
the
novels
including
mention
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
Season
finale
The
Children
when
Missandei
introduces
Daenerys
Targaryen
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
Moreover
she
was
speaking
in
Low
Valyrian
at
the
time
so
her
lines
were
actually
written
in
onscreen
subtitles
This
was
not
even
consistent
use
for
Missandei
and
Daenerys
within
Season
itself
earlier
in
episode
The
Laws
of
Gods
and
Men
Missandei
introduced
Daenerys
as
only
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
again
with
onscreen
subtitles
so
this
wasnt
just
a
mistake
by
the
actress
but
in
the
script
In
the
middle
of
Season
as
already
noted
no
mention
was
made
of
the
Rhoynar
in
the
title
even
at
Tommens
coronation
in
episode
when
Oberyn
Martell
was
standing
in
front
of
the
audience
No
official
word
has
come
down
to
make
sense
of
this
but
it
appears
to
simply
be
a
mistake
by
the
scriptwriters
ie
they
accidentally
wrote
the
full
bookversion
of
the
title
and
forgot
their
own
change
to
the
continuity
This
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
a
comment
George
RR
Martin
himself
made
It
is
true
that
the
Targaryen
succession
on
the
series
is
different
than
the
one
in
the
novels
most
notably
the
Mad
Kings
father
Jaehaerys
II
was
dropped
as
was
established
way
back
in
season
one
In
much
the
same
way
as
the
Rhoynar
have
been
dropped
from
the
royal
titles
King
of
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
etc
This
strongly
implies
that
there
was
an
actual
sitdown
meeting
of
the
writers
back
in
Season
when
they
formally
established
the
principle
that
the
title
in
the
TV
continuity
was
officially
going
to
be
shortened
to
just
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
and
as
a
scriptwriter
in
Season
Martin
was
aware
of
this
The
title
was
also
consistently
given
as
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
throughout
Season
omitting
the
Rhoynar
The
single
use
of
the
full
book
version
of
the
title
in
the
Season
finale
therefore
simply
appears
to
be
a
script
error
and
not
canonical
In
the
Season
premiere
however
Daenerys
once
again
switched
back
to
introducing
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men
without
explanation
At
this
point
it
is
again
unclear
what
the
title
is
officially
supposed
to
be
in
the
TV
continuity
The
TV
writers
could
have
retained
the
original
version
which
omitted
of
the
Rhoynar
or
they
could
have
initiated
a
retcon
by
adding
in
of
the
Rhoynar
from
Season
onwards
instead
they
inconsistently
flipflopped
between
the
two
forms
It
is
possible
that
the
two
terms
are
simply
interchangeable
Ruling
Queens
In
the
three
hundred
years
between
the
Targaryen
Conquest
and
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
there
has
never
been
a
Ruling
Queen
a
female
heir
of
the
current
monarch
inheriting
power
in
her
own
right
The
first
four
Targaryen
kings
all
had
male
heirs
who
were
also
their
eldest
child
However
the
fifth
Targaryen
king
Viserys
I
only
had
one
surviving
child
by
his
first
wife
before
she
died
a
daughter
named
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
With
no
other
heirs
Viserys
I
and
his
court
raised
Rhaenyra
with
the
expectation
that
she
would
be
the
first
Ruling
Queen
However
Viserys
I
remarried
late
in
life
and
had
several
sons
with
his
second
wife
the
eldest
of
which
was
his
son
Aegon
II
When
Viserys
I
died
this
sparked
a
succession
war
between
Rhaenyra
and
Aegon
II
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
which
raged
from
to
AL
about
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Aegon
II
ultimately
had
Rhaenyra
fed
alive
to
his
dragon
but
her
supporters
continued
to
fight
in
the
name
of
her
children
and
not
long
afterwards
Aegon
II
himself
died
childless
As
the
only
remaining
heir
of
Viserys
I
or
Aegon
II
Rhaenyras
own
son
Aegon
III
inherited
the
throne
Aegon
IIIs
own
sons
both
died
childless
and
ultimately
Rhaenyras
younger
son
Viserys
II
succeeded
to
the
throne
After
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons
the
Targaryens
revised
the
official
royal
succession
laws
to
follow
an
extreme
form
of
malepreference
primogeniture
placing
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
ones
ie
if
all
of
a
kings
sons
died
childless
his
own
younger
brothers
would
inherit
instead
of
his
daughters
their
nieces
Such
was
the
case
when
after
both
of
Aegon
IIIs
sons
died
childless
his
daughter
Daena
was
skipped
over
in
succession
for
Aegon
IIIs
younger
brother
Viserys
II
These
altered
inheritance
laws
ensured
that
there
was
no
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Many
historians
point
to
the
succession
of
Rhaenyras
son
Aegon
III
after
Aegon
II
died
as
proof
of
the
legitimacy
of
Rhaenyras
claim
to
inheritance
in
the
civil
war
and
while
she
lived
she
did
personally
use
the
title
of
Ruling
Queen
Officially
however
Rhaenyra
is
considered
a
rival
claimant
and
is
not
counted
in
the
formal
line
of
succession
Any
possible
future
Ruling
Queen
by
the
name
of
Rhaenyra
would
be
titled
Rhaenyra
I
not
Rhaenyra
II
As
this
would
lead
to
controversy
over
whether
to
acknowledge
Rhaenyras
claim
during
the
Dance
of
Dragons
subsequent
generations
of
the
Targaryen
family
simply
avoided
the
issue
by
never
naming
any
subsequent
daughters
Rhaenyra
At
the
end
of
season
where
King
Tommen
Baratheon
commits
suicide
after
the
destruction
of
the
Sept
of
Baelor
Cersei
Lannister
has
proclaimed
and
coronated
herself
as
Queen
of
the
Andals
and
the
First
Men
Cersei
considers
herself
the
first
true
Ruling
Queen
in
the
history
of
Westeros
but
then
again
so
did
Rhaenyra
future
historians
in
Westeros
will
decide
if
shes
just
another
rival
claimant
Cersei
claimed
the
Iron
Throne
without
any
legal
grounds
whatsoever
apparently
just
right
of
conquest

General
Author
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
the
storyline
in
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
is
partially
and
loosely
inspired
by
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
the
dynastic
conflict
that
occurred
in
England
intermittently
between
and
following
the
countrys
defeat
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
as
well
as
Maurice
Druons
novels
The
Accursed
Kings
about
the
history
of
the
French
Kings
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
Hundred
Years
War
Just
as
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
fought
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
the
conflict
in
Game
of
Thrones
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
The
technology
level
in
their
society
more
or
less
matches
late
medieval
Europe
ie
right
before
the
use
of
gunpowder
and
cannons
revolutionized
medieval
warfare
and
brought
it
into
the
Early
Modern
era
Magic
was
prevalent
in
the
world
in
the
longdistant
past
but
for
many
centuries
magical
power
has
dwindled
in
the
world
as
has
knowledge
of
its
use
While
a
handful
of
odd
cults
still
believe
in
magic
such
as
the
Alchemists
GuildandWarlocks
of
Qarth
they
can
do
little
to
substantiate
their
claims
The
general
population
considers
magic
to
have
never
existed
at
all
and
to
be
simply
mythical
a
view
promoted
by
the
Order
of
Maesters
who
champion
a
world
based
on
science
and
reason
and
scorn
the
very
idea
of
magic
The
mighty
Valyrian
Freehold
was
built
using
the
powerful
dragons
who
were
rumored
to
share
a
deep
link
with
magic
However
most
dragons
were
killed
in
the
Doom
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
before
the
narrative
of
Game
of
Thrones
begins
and
even
the
last
dragons
which
belonged
to
House
Targaryen
died
almost
two
centuries
ago
largely
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
Science
and
technology
have
not
significantly
advanced
in
the
past
several
centuries
Recorded
history
is
indeed
vastly
longer
in
the
fantasy
world
than
in
reallife
For
example
the
Valyrian
Freehold
existed
for
an
astonishing
five
thousand
years
before
its
fall
Written
history
in
Westeros
began
with
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
albeit
much
of
this
is
fragmentary
and
biased
see
main
article
Timeline
It
is
possible
that
in
earlier
ages
when
magic
was
more
prevalent
there
was
less
drive
to
innovate
new
tools
with
science
leaving
technology
levels
static
for
many
centuries
Even
so
while
the
general
rule
holds
that
gunpowder
has
not
been
discovered
there
is
not
a
oneforone
correspondence
between
the
technology
level
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
and
the
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
For
example
certain
medical
knowledge
is
much
more
advanced
and
accurate
in
Westeros
than
it
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
partially
because
certain
discoveries
in
history
have
been
accidental
ie
penicillin
not
the
culmination
of
a
long
aggregation
of
previous
discoveries
The
people
in
Westeros
and
beyond
are
also
capable
of
producing
vast
feats
of
architecture
such
as
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
without
the
use
of
magic
at
all
Martin
has
stated
that
medical
knowledge
is
officially
more
advanced
in
Westeros
than
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
I
made
a
deliberate
decision
when
the
books
began
to
have
the
maesters
and
have
Westeros
in
general
have
better
medical
knowledge
than
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
Mostly
because
I
didnt
want
everybody
dying
at
twentysix
So
it
is
generally
improved
the
maesters
have
improved
the
standard
of
hygiene
and
they
understand
certain
practices
and
they
can
do
things
better
Also
they
have
magic
While
this
might
seem
incongruent
with
the
otherwise
static
medieval
level
of
technology
in
Westeros
much
of
reallife
medical
knowledge
was
discovered
purely
through
trial
and
error
or
even
by
accident
such
as
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
The
maesters
might
not
know
the
underlying
theoretical
reasons
behind
illnesses
what
bacteria
and
viruses
are
but
they
have
accumulated
a
more
advanced
level
of
functional
medical
knowledge
for
practical
purposes
such
as
what
herb
mixtures
will
heal
infections
better
surgical
procedures
etc

Military
technology
in
Westeros
and
Essos
is
loosely
comparable
to
the
kinds
used
during
the
reallife
Hundred
Years
War
and
War
of
the
Roses
Crossbows
are
prevalent
though
they
have
not
superseded
longbows
which
are
also
quite
common
on
the
battlefield
again
much
like
the
s
in
reallife
northwestern
Europe
Various
kinds
of
advanced
siege
weapons
such
as
catapults
are
employed
Horse
cavalry
are
widely
used
and
some
regions
of
Essos
are
known
to
use
mounted
elephants
Heavy
cavalry
using
mounted
knights
in
full
plate
armor
is
a
mainstay
of
the
battlefield
though
they
are
more
commonly
fielded
by
the
wealthier
regions
of
Westeros
ie
the
Reach
or
the
Westerlands
while
the
poorer
kingdoms
such
as
The
North
or
the
Iron
Islands
make
do
with
chain
mail
instead
of
full
plate
armor
Many
armies
frequently
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
mercenaries
Valyrian
steel
is
a
type
of
metal
forged
in
the
oncemighty
Valyrian
Freehold
used
to
make
swords
that
are
exceptionally
sharp
and
tremendously
strong
The
knowledge
of
how
to
create
Valyrian
steel
was
lost
in
the
fall
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
ago
making
the
few
surviving
Valyrian
steel
swords
incredibly
rare
and
expensive
Valyrian
steel
is
rumored
to
have
been
forged
with
the
aid
of
magic
spells
and
dragonfire
Gunpowder
does
not
exist
in
the
medieval
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
They
do
possess
Wildfire
a
highly

to
divulge
how
wildfire
is
created
but
claim
that
it
is
done
with
magical
spells
a
claim
dismissed
by
others
particularly
the
maesters
Even
so
Wildfire
is
similar
to
real
life
Greek
fire
which
was
actually
used
by
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
medieval
times
and
thus
was
actually
a
technology
known
to
medieval
peoples
and
thus
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
for
a
medieval
setting
Dragons
were
of
course
used
in
warfare
but
they
are
more
of
a
magicbased
fantasy
creature
Moreover
the
last
known
dragons
in
the
world
died
out
two
hundred
years
ago
largely
due
to
many
of
them
being
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
in
which
dragons
were
used
to
kill
other
dragons
Thus
dragons
have
not
been
used
on
the
battlefield
in
two
centuries

Currency
See
main
article
Currency
Several
different
types
of
currency
are
used
in
the
worlds
various
economies
The
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros
have
a
uniform
system
of
coinage
based
on
the
Gold
Dragon
coin
The
different
cities
and
nations
across
the
Narrow
Sea
on
Essos
use
their
own
various
local
currencies
Books
and
writing
Different
societies
have
their
own
writing
systems
The
main
one
encountered
is
the
one
used
for
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
throughout
Westeros
The
Andals
introduced
the
first
full
writing
system
to
Westeros
the
First
Men
before
them
only
used
a
basic
rune
script
for
the
Old
Tongue
which
was
only
used
for
basic
inscriptions
on
grave
markers
etc
The
Dothraki
do
not
have
a
written
language
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
the
Valyrian
languages
in
the
Free
Cities
and
Slavers
Bay
have
their
own
glyphbased
writing
systems
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
represent
this
in
the
TV
series
The
novels
refer
to
characters
in
Westeros
using
both
parchment
made
from
animal
skins
and
paper
made
from
wood
pulp
This
is
not
incongruous
to
the
setting
paper
was
introduced
to
real
life
Western
Europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
though
it
did
not
surpass
use
of
parchment
for
many
centuries
Generally
parchment
was
still
used
for
important
documents
legal
charters
important
diplomatic
messages
etc
while
paper
was
a
cheap
less
durable
alternative
Given
that
Westeros
is
loosely
based
on
the
War
of
the
Roses
in
England
during
the
s
it
is
not
contradictory
that
their
society
uses
a
mix
of
paper
or
parchment
for
different
tasks
Paper
seems
to
be
often
used
for
more
common
tasks
the
messages
sent
via
the
raven
network
are
described
as
being
written
on
little
scrolls
of
paper
paper
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
parchment
so
it
is
probably
easier
to
roll
easier
to
fit
more
writing
on
each
roll
and
easier
for
the
birds
to
carry
More
important
handdelivered
messages
tend
to
be
written
on
parchment
particularly
royal
decrees
from
Kings
Landing
Most
if
not
all
books
are
made
out
of
parchment
not
paper
books
are
usually
commissioned
or
handcopied
and
thus
more
like
luxury
items
so
anyone
commissioning
one
will
have
it
made
of
high
quality
They
dont
have
cheap
massproduced
paper
books
No
mention
has
been
made
of
printing
press
technology
and
it
apparently
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
and
probably
not
in
Essos
either
The
printing
press
was
only
introduced
in
reallife
Medieval
Europe
in
the
mids
and
took
time
to
be
implemented
again
matching
the
general
historical
period
of
the
setting
It
is
unknown
if
other
societies
use
earlier
forms
of
printing
such
as
woodblock
printing
etc

Measurement
Measurements
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
are
given
in
imperial
measurements
As
they
are
a
medieval
society
their
systems
of
measurements
weights
and
coinage
grew
haphazardly
out
of
local
customs
instead
of
any
rational
basis
For
example
the
Wall
is
miles
long
and
feet
tall
converted
to
the
metric
system
for
the
benefit
of
some
viewers
the
Wall
is
kilometers
long
and
between
and
meters
tall
Weights
are
rarely
mentioned
in
the
TV
series
but
it
has
been
said
that
pounds
tons
and
ounces
are
used
to
measure
them
These
are
also
nonmetric
units
as
kilograms
do
not
exist
as
a
unit
in
Westeros
in
the
books
the
old
nonmetric
unit
of
stones
is
also
used
one
stone
equals
about
pounds
Smaller
distances
can
be
measured
in
yards
Animals
and
Plants
See
main
article
Animals
and
Plants
Several
notable
animal
and
plant
species
exist
in
Westeros
and
the
Known
World
Some
of
these
have
no
real
world
counterparts
but
many
are
based
on
ice
age
megafauna
which
did
exist
in
reallife
but
went
extinct
thousands
of
years
ago
On
the
whole
it
is
very
unusual
to
encounter
animals
that
are
significantly
different
than
encountered
in
reallife
medieval
Europe
and
the
Near
East
A
few
animals
have
no
oneforone
counterpart
with
real
life
ones
ie
shadowcats
are
common
animals
somewhere
in
size
between
a
cougar
and
a
tiger
but
not
exactly
like
either
In
general
however
even
direwolves
are
a
very
rare
and
unusual
animal
for
the
inhabitants
of
Westeros
to
encounter
in
keeping
with
George
RR
Martins
attempts
to
create
a
more
realistic
gritty
fantasy
world
Animals
Dragons
winged
reptiles
of
tremendous
age
and
ferocity
capable
of
breathing
fire
Originated
in
the
east
and
enslaved
by
the
Valyrians
who
used
them
to
forge
their
empire
Most
dragons
were
destroyed
in
the
Doom
four
centuries
ago
leaving
the
few
possessed
by
House
Targaryen
as
the
only
surviving
dragons
in
the
world
which
they
used
in
their
invasion
of
Westeros
The
last
Targaryen
dragons
died
over
years
ago
The
skulls
of
more
than
a
dozen
dragons
are
kept
in
the
Red
Keep
Direwolves
a
larger
cousin
of
regular
wolves
only
found
north
of
the
Wall
In
the
south
they
are
considered
nearmythical
Occasional
sightings
of
direwolves
have
been
reported
by
the
Nights
Watch
but
at
the
time
the
series
starts
there
have
been
no
confirmed
sightings
south
of
the
Wall
for
centuries
Horses
A
common
animal
bred
all
over
Westeros
commonly
used
as
methods
of
transport
Krakens
massive
cephalopods
that
stalk
the
worlds
oceans
So
rare
that
they
are
largely
held
to
be
mythical
though
sailors
occasionally
report
seeing
them

in

they
have
been

General
Author
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
the
storyline
in
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
is
partially
and
loosely
inspired
by
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
the
dynastic
conflict
that
occurred
in
England
intermittently
between
and
following
the
countrys
defeat
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
as
well
as
Maurice
Druons
novels
The
Accursed
Kings
about
the
history
of
the
French
Kings
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
Hundred
Years
War
Just
as
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
fought
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
the
conflict
in
Game
of
Thrones
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
The
technology
level
in
their
society
more
or
less
matches
late
medieval
Europe
ie
right
before
the
use
of
gunpowder
and
cannons
revolutionized
medieval
warfare
and
brought
it
into
the
Early
Modern
era
Magic
was
prevalent
in
the
world
in
the
longdistant
past
but
for
many
centuries
magical
power
has
dwindled
in
the
world
as
has
knowledge
of
its
use
While
a
handful
of
odd
cults
still
believe
in
magic
such
as
the
Alchemists
GuildandWarlocks
of
Qarth
they
can
do
little
to
substantiate
their
claims
The
general
population
considers
magic
to
have
never
existed
at
all
and
to
be
simply
mythical
a
view
promoted
by
the
Order
of
Maesters
who
champion
a
world
based
on
science
and
reason
and
scorn
the
very
idea
of
magic
The
mighty
Valyrian
Freehold
was
built
using
the
powerful
dragons
who
were
rumored
to
share
a
deep
link
with
magic
However
most
dragons
were
killed
in
the
Doom
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
before
the
narrative
of
Game
of
Thrones
begins
and
even
the
last
dragons
which
belonged
to
House
Targaryen
died
almost
two
centuries
ago
largely
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
Science
and
technology
have
not
significantly
advanced
in
the
past
several
centuries
Recorded
history
is
indeed
vastly
longer
in
the
fantasy
world
than
in
reallife
For
example
the
Valyrian
Freehold
existed
for
an
astonishing
five
thousand
years
before
its
fall
Written
history
in
Westeros
began
with
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
albeit
much
of
this
is
fragmentary
and
biased

Timeline
It
is
possible
that
in
earlier
ages
when
magic
was
more
prevalent
there
was
less
drive
to
innovate
new
tools
with
science
leaving
technology
levels
static
for
many
centuries
Even
so
while
the
general
rule
holds
that
gunpowder
has
not
been
discovered
there
is
not
a
oneforone
correspondence
between
the
technology
level
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
and
the
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
For
example
certain
medical
knowledge
is
much
more
advanced
and
accurate
in
Westeros
than
it
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
partially
because
certain
discoveries
in
history
have
been
accidental
ie
penicillin
not
the
culmination
of
a
long
aggregation
of
previous
discoveries
The
people
in
Westeros
and
beyond
are
also
capable
of
producing
vast
feats
of
architecture
such
as
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
without
the
use
of
magic
at
all
Martin
has
stated
that
medical
knowledge
is
officially
more
advanced
in
Westeros
than
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
I
made
a
deliberate
decision
when
the
books
began
to
have
the
maesters
and
have
Westeros
in
general
have
better
medical
knowledge
than
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
Mostly
because
I
didnt
want
everybody
dying
at
twentysix
So
it
is
generally
improved
the
maesters
have
improved
the
standard
of
hygiene
and
they
understand
certain
practices
and
they
can
do
things
better
Also
they
have
magic
While
this
might
seem
incongruent
with
the
otherwise
static
medieval
level
of
technology
in
Westeros
much
of
reallife
medical
knowledge
was
discovered
purely
through
trial
and
error
or
even
by
accident
such
as
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
The
maesters
might
not
know
the
underlying
theoretical
reasons
behind
illnesses
what
bacteria
and
viruses
are
but
they
have
accumulated
a
more
advanced
level
of
functional
medical
knowledge
for
practical
purposes
such
as
what
herb
mixtures
will
heal
infections
better
surgical
procedures
etc
Medicine
See
main
article
Medicine
Military
Technology
See
main
article
Armament
Military
technology
in
Westeros
and
Essos
is
loosely
comparable
to
the
kinds
used
during
the
reallife
Hundred
Years
War
and
War
of
the
Roses
Crossbows
are
prevalent
though
they
have
not
superseded
longbows
which
are
also
quite
common
on
the
battlefield
again
much
like
the
s
in
reallife
northwestern
Europe
Various
kinds
of
advanced
siege
weapons
such
as
catapults
are
employed
Horse
cavalry
are
widely
used
and
some
regions
of
Essos
are
known
to
use
mounted
elephants
Heavy
cavalry
using
mounted
knights
in
full
plate
armor
is
a
mainstay
of
the
battlefield
though
they
are
more
commonly
fielded
by
the
wealthier
regions
of
Westeros
ie
the
Reach
or
the
Westerlands
while
the
poorer
kingdoms
such
as
The
North
or
the
Iron
Islands
make
do
with
chain
mail
instead
of
full
plate
armor
Many
armies
frequently
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
mercenaries
Valyrian
steel
is
a
type
of
metal
forged
in
the
oncemighty
Valyrian
Freehold
used
to
make
swords
that
are
exceptionally
sharp
and
tremendously
strong
The
knowledge
of
how
to
create
Valyrian
steel
was
lost
in
the
fall
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
ago
making
the
few
surviving
Valyrian
steel
swords
incredibly
rare
and
expensive
Valyrian
steel
is
rumored
to
have
been
forged
with
the
aid
of
magic
spells
and
dragonfire
Gunpowder
does
not
exist
in
the
medieval
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
They
do
possess
Wildfire
a
highly
flammable
and
explosive
napalmlike
substance
the
Alchemists
Guild
refuses
to
divulge
how
wildfire
is
created
but
claim
that
it
is
done
with
magical
spells
a
claim
dismissed
by
others
particularly
the
maesters
Even
so
Wildfire
is
similar
to
real
life
Greek
fire
which
was
actually
used
by
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
medieval
times
and
thus
was
actually
a
technology
known
to
medieval
peoples
and
thus
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
for
a
medieval
setting
Dragons
were
of
course
used
in
warfare
but
they
are
more
of
a
magicbased
fantasy
creature
Moreover
the
last
known
dragons
in
the
world
died
out
two
hundred
years
ago
largely
due
to
many
of
them
being
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
in
which
dragons
were
used
to
kill
other
dragons
Thus
dragons
have
not
been
used
on
the
battlefield
in
two
centuries

Currency
See
main
article
Currency
Several
different
types
of
currency
are
used
in
the
worlds
various
economies
The
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros
have
a
uniform
system
of
coinage
based
on
the
Gold
Dragon
coin
The
different
cities
and
nations
across
the
Narrow
Sea
on
Essos
use
their
own
various
local
currencies
Books
and
writing
Different
societies
have
their
own
writing
systems
The
main
one
encountered
is
the
one
used
for
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
throughout
Westeros
The
Andals
introduced
the
first
full
writing
system
to
Westeros
the
First
Men
before
them
only
used
a
basic
rune
script
for
the
Old
Tongue
which
was
only
used
for
basic
inscriptions
on
grave
markers
etc
The
Dothraki
do
not
have
a
written
language
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
the
Valyrian
languages
in
the
Free
Cities
and
Slavers
Bay
have
their
own
glyphbased
writing
systems
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
represent
this
in
the
TV
series
The
novels
refer
to
characters
in
Westeros
using
both
parchment
made
from
animal
skins
and
paper
made
from
wood
pulp
This
is
not
incongruous
to
the
setting
paper
was
introduced
to
real
life
Western
Europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
though
it
did
not
surpass
use
of
parchment
for
many
centuries
Generally
parchment
was
still
used
for
important
documents
legal
charters
important
diplomatic
messages
etc
while
paper
was
a
cheap
less
durable
alternative
Given
that
Westeros
is
loosely
based
on
the
War
of
the
Roses
in
England
during
the
s
it
is
not
contradictory
that
their
society
uses
a
mix
of
paper
or
parchment
for
different
tasks
Paper
seems
to
be
often
used
for
more
common
tasks
the
messages
sent
via
the
raven
network
are
described
as
being
written
on
little
scrolls
of
paper
paper
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
parchment
so
it
is
probably
easier
to
roll
easier
to
fit
more
writing
on
each
roll
and
easier
for
the
birds
to
carry
More
important
handdelivered
messages
tend
to
be
written
on
parchment
particularly
royal
decrees
from
Kings
Landing
Most
if
not
all
books
are
made
out
of
parchment
not
paper
books
are
usually
commissioned
or
handcopied
and
thus
more
like
luxury
items
so
anyone
commissioning
one
will
have
it
made
of
high
quality
They
dont
have
cheap
massproduced
paper
books
No
mention
has
been
made
of
printing
press
technology
and
it
apparently
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
and
probably
not
in
Essos
either
The
printing
press
was
only
introduced
in
reallife
Medieval
Europe
in
the
mids
and
took
time
to
be
implemented
again
matching
the
general
historical
period
of
the
setting
It
is
unknown
if
other
societies
use
earlier
forms
of
printing
such
as
woodblock
printing
etc

Measurement
Measurements
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
are
given
in
imperial
measurements
As
they
are
a
medieval
society
their
systems
of
measurements
weights
and
coinage
grew
haphazardly
out
of
local
customs
instead
of
any
rational
basis
For
example
the
Wall
is
miles
long
and
feet
tall
converted
to
the
metric
system
for
the
benefit
of
some
viewers
the
Wall
is
kilometers
long
and
between
and
meters
tall
Weights
are
rarely
mentioned
in
the
TV
series
but
it
has
been
said
that
pounds
tons
and
ounces
are
used
to
measure
them
These
are
also
nonmetric
units
as
kilograms
do
not
exist
as
a
unit
in
Westeros
in
the
books
the
old
nonmetric
unit
of
stones
is
also
used
one
stone
equals
about
pounds
Smaller
distances
can
be
measured
in
yards
Animals
and
Plants
See
main
article
Animals
and
Plants
Several
notable
animal
and
plant
species
exist
in
Westeros
and
the
Known
World
Some
of
these
have
no
real
world
counterparts
but
many
are
based
on
ice
age
megafauna
which
did
exist
in
reallife
but
went
extinct
thousands
of
years
ago
On
the
whole
it
is
very
unusual
to
encounter
animals
that
are
significantly
different
than
encountered
in
reallife
medieval
Europe
and
the
Near
East
A
few
animals
have
no
oneforone
counterpart
with
real
life
ones
ie
shadowcats
are
common
animals
somewhere
in
size
between
a
cougar
and
a
tiger
but
not
exactly
like
either
In
general
however
even
direwolves
are
a
very
rare
and
unusual
animal
for
the
inhabitants
of
Westeros
to
encounter
in
keeping
with
George
RR
Martins
attempts
to
create
a
more
realistic
gritty
fantasy
world
Animals
Dragons
winged
reptiles
of
tremendous
age
and
ferocity
capable
of
breathing
fire
Originated
in
the
east
and
enslaved
by
the
Valyrians
who
used
them
to
forge
their
empire
Most
dragons
were
destroyed
in
the
Doom
four
centuries
ago
leaving
the
few
possessed
by
House
Targaryen
as
the
only
surviving
dragons
in
the
world
which
they
used
in
their
invasion
of
Westeros
The
last
Targaryen
dragons
died
over
years
ago
The
skulls
of
more
than
a
dozen
dragons
are
kept
in
the
Red
Keep
Direwolves
a
larger
cousin
of
regular
wolves
only
found
north
of
the
Wall
In
the
south
they
are
considered
nearmythical
Occasional
sightings
of
direwolves
have
been
reported
by
the
Nights
Watch
but
at
the
time
the
series
starts
there
have
been
no
confirmed
sightings
south
of
the
Wall
for
centuries
Horses
A
common
animal
bred
all
over
Westeros
commonly
used
as

of
transport
Krakens
massive
cephalopods
that
stalk

oceans
So
rare
that
they
are
largely

seeing
them

imprisoned
by
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
Queen
Cersei
confesses
to
having
committed
adultery
with
her
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
who
had
joined
the
Faith
Militant
and
accused
her
of
adultery
incest
and
regicide
The
High
Sparrow
informs
Cersei
that
she
will
still
be
tried
for
the
other
two
charges
that
she
denies
while
allowing
her
to
return
to
the
Red
Keep
only
if
she
performs
a
walk
of
atonement
as
penance
for
her
confessed
sin
Cerseis
hair
is
cut
short
and
then
she
is
presented
to
the
population
of
Kings
Landing
so
they
will
bear
witness
to
her
confession
and
penitence
She
is
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
made
to
walk
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
to
the
Red
Keep
escorted
by
members
of
the
Faith
Militant
who
keep
away
the
leering
and
jeering
crowds
who
have
gathered
to
see
her
shame
and
take
the
chance
to
insult
their
hated
Queen
Mother
As
she
walks
Septa
Unella
accompanies
her
repeatedly
crying
out
Shame
and
ringing
a
bell
to
attract
peoples
attention
Season
When
King
Tommen
Baratheon
becomes
loyal
to
the
faith
the
High
Sparrow
tells
him
that
his
wife
Margaery
Tyrell
must
perform
a
walk
of
atonement
He
is
reluctant
to
tell
his
mother
after
being
counseled
by
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
however
he
later
tells
Cersei
At
a
Small
Council
meeting
Cersei
informs
Olenna
Tyrell
that
Margaery
will
perform
her
walk
of
atonement
before
the
day
of
her
trial
and
they
both
agree
this
cannot
happen
However
at
the
Standoff
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
House
Tyrell
and
Jaime
Lannister
try
to
revert
it
The
High
Sparrow
then
concludes
that
Margaery
is
ultimately
spared
from
her
walk
as
she
is
already
repented
for
her
crimes
due
to
uncovering
House
Lannisters
treachery
against
the
sparrows
Tommen
then
agrees
to
an
alliance
with
the
High
Sparrow
symbolizing
the
union
of
the
crown
and
the
faith
When
Jaime
Lannister
is
formally
removed
from
the
Kingsguard
for
threatening
the
Faith
he
sarcastically
asks
if
he
will
be
forced
to
make
a
walk
of
atonement
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
it
seems
that
walks
of
atonement
are
civil
punishments
used
to
publicly
shame
women
accused
of
adultery
or
prostitution
It
also
serves
as
a
means
of
degrading
these
women
and
stripping
them
of
whatever
pride
or
power
they
might
hold
The
novels
mention
only
two
people
who
had
to
go
through
this
humiliating
punishment
Tytos
Lannisters
mistress
and
Cersei
Tywin
Lannister
forced
his
fathers
mistress
to
make
a
walk
of
atonement
after
Lord
Tytos
died
While
it
is
common
for
widowed
lords
to
take
lowborn
women
as
bedwarmers
Tytoss
mistress
a
woman
scarcely
one
step
above
a
prostitute
had
come
to
dominate
him
utterly
she
was
seated
beside
him
in
the
hall
showered
with
gifts
and
honors
and
even
asked
for
her
views
on
matters
of
state
She
stole
from
him
issued
orders
to
the
household
knights
dismissed
servants
and
helped
herself
to
the
jewelry
of
the
late
Lady
Jeyne
Tytoss
wife
She
grew
so
influential
that
it
was
said
around
Lannisport
that
any
man
who
wished
for
his
petition
to
be
heard
should
kneel
before
her
and
speak
loudly
to
her
lap
for
Lord
Tytoss
ear
was
between
his
ladys
legs
Lord
Tytos
died
of
a
heart
attack
while
climbing
stairs
to
his
mistress
and
the
first
thing
Tywin
did
on
his
return
from
Kings
Landing
was
to
expel
her
from
Casterly
Rock
All
the
selfseekers
who
had
named
themselves
her
friends
and
cultivated
her
favor
abandoned
her
The
silks
and
velvets
Tytos
had
lavished
on
her
were
taken
away
as
was
the
jewelry
she
had
appropriated
Tywin
had
her
stripped
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Lannisport
to
the
docks
for
a
fortnight
telling
everyone
she
met
that
she
was
a
thief
and
a
whore
Though
no
man
laid
a
hand
on
her
that
walk
spelled
the
end
of
her
power
Cersei
was
too
young
to
witness
the
spectacle
herself
but
heard
the
stories
from
washerwomen
and
guardsmen
who
had
been
there
Although
Cerseis
uncle
Kevan
Lannister
disapproved
of
many
of
her
deeds
her
incestuous
affair
with
Jaime
corrupting
Lancel
spoiling
Joffrey
and
her
poor
conduct
as
the
Queen
Regent
he
does
not
gloat
at
Cersei
but
feels
sorry
for
her
public
humiliation
He
muses
sadly
that
Tywin
would
have
never
dreamed
that
the
same
degrading
punishment
he
gave
their
fathers
mistress
would
be
imposed
on
his
own
daughter
In
the
novels
when
Cersei
is
shorn
the
septas
remove
all
of
her
body
hair
her
eyebrows
pubic
hair
even
scraping
the
rest
of
her
body
They
shave
her
head
completely
bald
In
the
TV
episode
the
septas
prominently
produce
a
razor
blade
as
if
they
are
going
to
shave
her
but
curiously
does
not
use
it
at
all
One
septa
separately
picks
up
a
pair
of
shears
and
cuts
Cerseis
luxurious
long
golden
hair
off
but
crops
it
close
to
her
head
instead
of
shaving
her
bald
entirely
In
her
subsequent
nude
scenes
the
rest
of
her
body
hair
isnt
shaved
While
Cersei
performs
the
walk
of
atonement
she
hallucinates
many
characters
most
of
them
are
long
dead
standing
among
the
crowd

another
queen
who
will
cast
Cersei
down
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
Cerseis
walk
of
atonement
is
loosely
based
on
what
happened
to
Jane
Shore
the
mistress
of
King
Edward
IV
of
England
Like
Robert
Baratheon
Edward
was
a
great
warrior
who
won
the
crown
on
the
battlefield
in
his
youth
but
became
fat
and
illsuited
to
rule
in
later
life
After
Edward
died
his
brother
Richard
III
usurped
the
throne
ahead
of
Edwards
sons
He
deeply
resented
Jane
so
he
had
her
arrested
and
made
her
perform
a
penance
walk
a
common
punishment
for
harlotry
Jane
did
not
perform
the
penance
walk
naked
however
but
had
to
walk
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
London
wearing
only
her
kirtle
petticoat
which
at
the
time
was
still
said
to
have
gained
significant
male
attention
the
main
source
of
the
humiliation
was
that
this
was
a
punishment
normally
meted
out
to
harlots
Martin
has
said
that
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
one
of
the
major
inspirations
for
his
novels
the
conflict
was
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
while
in
Westeros
the
conflict
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
clearly
named
after
the
real
families

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
based
on
a

In

Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to

Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into

are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out

prove
her
loyalty
as

of

are
read
out
and
Barristan
Selmys
position
is
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
Jaime
Lannister
a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as
Sansa
seeks
pardon
for
her
fathers
actions
Baelish
watches
on
as
Eddard
Stark
confesses
at
his
trial
and
is

telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling

counters
him

Sansa
accuses
him
of

Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of

Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected

the
whole

of

and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven
the

led

his
death

Petyr

A
useful
talent
Im

Those

Chaos

Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a

Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try

climb
it
fail

never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the

or

Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there
is
Littlefinger

Always
keep
your
foes
confused
If

little
They
spend
their
lives
avoiding
danger
And
then
they
die

get
what
I

Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore
videos
on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show

Lord
Paramount
of
the
Riverlands
or
not
I
am
aware
this
has
been
discussed
and
described
as
unclear
but
nevertheless
the
administrators
voted
and
decided
that
for
now
its
a
good
idea
to
establish
the
Freys
as
the
Lords
of
the
land
However
the
confusion
remains
in
several
articles
and
the
House
Baelish
box
too
and
honestly
I
dont
see
how
any
of
it
is
unclear
Lets
review
the
evidence
In
Valar
Morghulis
Petyr
is
given
Harrenhal
and
its
lands
no
mention
at
all
is
made
of
the
seat
of
the
Riverlands
being
changed
to
Harrenhal
In
Oathkeeper
when
Sansa
is
recounting
all
the
things
the
Lannisters
have
done
for
him
she
brings
up
wealth
and
power
and
specifically
that
they
made
him
the
Lord
of
Harrenhal
Thats
the
second
opportunity
for
the
change
of
seat
to
be
mentioned
but
it
wasnt
Previously
in
Mysha
Walder
Frey
was
made
Lord
of
Riverrun
again
the
seat
of
the
Riverlands
is
not
said
to
have
shifted
away
from
the
traditional
castle
This
is
reinforced
by
Brienne
in
Mockingbird
However
the
most
compelling
evidence
may
come
from
a
farmer
in
Breaker
of
Chains
who
strongly
implies
the
Freys
rule
the
Riverlands
In
fact
thats
the
only
context
in
which
his
words
make
sense
The
Red
Wedding
theyre
calling
it
Walder
Frey
committed
sacrilege
that
day
He
shared
bread
and
salt
with
the
Starks
He
offered
them
guest
right
The
gods
will
have
their
vengeance
Frey
will
burn
in
the
seventh
hell
for
what
he
did
Things
were
different
when
Hoster
Tully
ruled
the
Riverlands
This
means
in
the
show
the
Freys
rule
the
Riverlands
now
this
is
not
unclear
at
all
The
only
reason
for
confusion
is
that
its
different
in
the
books
but
its
been
made
pretty
clear
in
the
show
No
the
show
has
not
focused
on
it
and
with
Jaime
in
Dorne
maybe
it
wont
for
a
while
but
the
available
evidence
tells
us
a
particular
story
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
Petyr
Baelish
Put
simply
the
Freys
werent
snubbed
as
they
were
in
the
books
and
they
now
rule
the
Riverlands
Whats
more
important
the
administrators
already
ruled
this
and
decided
that
at
least
for
now
Walder
Frey
should
be
considered
the
Lord
Paramount
So
why
havent
some
of
the
relevant
articles
been
changed
since
then

What
Littlefingers
endgame
is
Even
book
fans
arent
entirely
sure
what
Littlefinger
is
trying
to
do
in
the
long
run
I
just
watched
a
couple
of
crackpot
theory
videos
on
youtube
none
of
which
individually
made
sense
but
which
did
point
out
some
solid
facts
from
the
books
which
I
hadnt
thought
of
Partially
Littlefinger
wants
revenge
on
the
Starks
Tullys
possibly
even
the
Vale
lordshes
a
psychopath
and
started
a
war
killing
thousands
of
people
because
he
felt
snubbed
by
life
as
a
minor
lord
granted
he
went
kind
of
crazy
after
Brandon
Stark
nearly
killed
him
in
a
duel
and
in
the
books
Lysa
basically
raped
him
pretending
to
be
Catelyn
got
pregnant
then
her
father
Hoster
forced
her
to
have
an
abortion
of
his
unborn
child
so
yeahas
seen
in
the
TV
series
though
inwardly
he
has
this
really
warped
view
of
the
world
hes
a
stalker
who
thinks
he
had
a
grand
love
story
with
Catelyn
who
was
at
best
a
platonic
friend
in
his
childhood
But
in
terms
of
his
specific
actions
and
their
results
First
it
was
already
fairly
obvious
that
Littlefinger
engineered
the
entire
debt
crisis
see
Currency
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
ridiculous
it
is
for
the
realm
to
be
million
Gold
Dragons
in
debt
Thats
astronomical
Note
how
shocked
Eddard
was
in
the
TV
series
After
becoming
Master
of
Coin
even
Tyrion
points
out
how
implausible
this
is
consider
that
the
prize
money
at
the
Tourney
of
the
Hand
was
Gold
Dragons
a
massive
amount
of
money
Robert
was
king
for
years
in
the
novels
million
divided
by
is
Robert
would
have
to
have
had
Tourney
of
the
Hand
scale
events
to
rack
up
that
much
debtand
they
imply
that
this
was
an
unusually
large
tournament
even
for
him
or
at
least
uncommon
divided
by
years
is
four
per
year
Robert
would
have
to
have
held
a
Tourney
of
the
Hand
scale
event
every
three
months
for
years
to
make
that
much
debt
None
of
these
oldschool
aristocrats
sat
down
and
did
the
math
before
Tyrion
and
asked
how
Robert
could
possibly
have
caused
that
much
debt
Heck
Tywin
also
mentions
that
you
know
its
been
summer
for
ten
years
gross
income
levels
are
great
from
good
harvests
Also
due
to
improvements
in
administration
since
the
Mad
King
the
combined
effect
is
that
Tywin
says
that
the
gross
income
levels
are
something
like
tenfold
what
they
were
during
Roberts
Rebellion
plus
the
Mad
King
had
been
hoarding
gold
so
when
the
war
ended
they
took
the
royal
treasury
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
war
debt
So
even
Tyrion
within
the
story
begins
to
suspect
Littlefinger
of
massive
embezzlement
By
A
Feast
for
Crows
we
directly
see
that
Littlefinger
is
winning
the
allegiance
of
multiple
Vale
Houses
by
paying
off
their
large
debtsdebts
which
now
that
I
think
about
it
he
must
have
engineered
I
think
his
entire
plan
was
basically
to
steal
millions
of
Gold
Dragons
causing
a
debt
crisis
which
makes
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
call
in
all
of
its
loans
across
Westeros
which
happens
in
AFFC
and
then
surprise
surprise
he
pops
up
with
all
of
this
private
wealth
to
pay
off
the
debts
of
noble
families
buying
their
allegiance
Hes
bribing
off
the
noble
Houses
who
have
no
money
using
the
very
same
money
that
he
basically
stole
from
them
If
that
sounds
complicatedconsider
that
this
is
not
that
far
removed
from
what
banks
do
now
what
with
the
recession
crisis
and
such
Extort
a
lot
of
money
lack
of
governmental
controls
then
loan
people
their
own
money
back
to
them
But
all
of
that
was
pretty
clear
Littlefinger
manipulating
the
debt
crisis
Second
Littlefinger
wanted
to
cause
a
succession
war
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
to
exhaust
the
armies
of
anyone
who
might
oppose
him
He
didnt
just
want
a
quick
victory
for
either
side
his
goal
was
to
play
them
off
against
each
other
and
whenever
it
looked
like
one
side
was
winning
to
much
balance
them
out
again
Littlefinger
was
decidedly
not
a
planner
of
the
Red
Wedding
he
didnt
want
a
quick
Lannister
victory
but
to
keep
dragging
out
the
war
for
years
though
a
large
amount
of
the
damage
he
wanted
was
already
done
both
sides
were
already
nearexhausted
Littlefinger
didnt
just
want
Ned
Stark
to
get
killed
he
wanted
him
in
the
capital
city
to
officially
challenge
Joffreys
right
to
rule
and
publicly
accuse
Cersei
that
Joffrey
is
a
bastard
of
incest
This
is
why
he
kept
Ned
alive
for
as
long
as
he
did
and
even
saved
him
from
Jaime
outside
the
brothel
by
rushing
to
get
the
Gold
Cloaks
Jaime
could
very
easily
have
killed
Ned
if
events
turned
otherwise
He
needed
him
in
the
capital
city
moreover
because
Littlefinger
owns
the
Gold
Cloaks
through
bribery
Thats
why
he
kept
escorting
Ned
around
to
Jon
Arryns
other
bastards
in
the
novels
Ned
was
planning
on
leaving
Kings
Landing
in
disgust
when
he
resigned
over
Daenerysbut
Littlefinger
insisted
on
showing
him
another
bastard
in
a
brothel
before
he
left
Unwilling
to
pass
up
another
clue
about
what
happened
to
Jon
Arryn
Ned
agreed
He
needed
Ned
in
the
capital
city
because
thats
where
Littlefinger
has
soldiers
Gold
Cloaks
and
can
eventually
turn
on
him
manipulating
events
The
key
point
is
that
through
his
spy
network
Littlefinger
found
out
about
the
incest
between
Jaime
and
Cersei
and
Joffreys
real
parentage
though
others
also
figured
this
out
such
as
Varys
and
even
Stannis
seems
to
have
had
his
suspicions
for
a
while
beforehand
none
of
Cerseis
children
looked
anything
like
Robert
Littlefinger
then
led
Jon
Arryn
to
discover
the
lineage
book
pointing
out
that
every
time
a
Baratheon
marries
a
Lannister
the
child
is
dark
haired
its
a
dominant
trait
the
seed
is
strong
Even
so
he
couldnt
guarantee
that
the
Lannisters
would
assassinate
Jon
Arryn
though
he
hoped
they
would
because
as
Neds
fosterfather
of
sorts
his
death
would
spark
suspicion
and
bring
Ned
to
Kings
Landing
it
appears
that
Littlefinger
manipulation
the
suspicions
of
the
Lannisters
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Jon
Arryn
became
so
afraid
of
the
Lannisters
that
he
began
making
plans
to
have
his
young
son
Sweetrobin
fostered
out
at
another
castle
ie
Dragonstone
away
from
the
royal
court
maybe
Littlefinger
even
suggested
it
Because
he
knew
this
is
what
would
drive
Lysa
Arryn
into
a
murderous
rage
she
couldnt
stand
the
thought
of
her
son
being
taken
away
from
her
even
for
his
own
protection
Cersei
later
got
wind
of
it
and
wanted
Robert
to
foster
Sweetrobin
at
Casterly
Rock
in
stead
Anyway
this
is
how
Littlefinger
convinces
Lysa
to
assassinate
her
own
husband
setting
the
events
of
the
narrative
in
motion
accidentally
lead
Jon
Arryn
to
learn
of
Cerseis
secret
convince
Jon
that
the
Lannisters
suspect
he
knows
and
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
send
his
son
away
from
the
capital
when
he
could
have
sent
both
Lysa
and
Sweetrobin
back
to
the
Vale
he
may
have
convinced
Jon
this
looked
too
suspicious
and
use
Jon
taking
Sweetrobin
away
to
manipulate
Lysa
into
killing
him
In
turn
This
brings
Ned
Stark
to
Kings
Landing
combined
with
the
fact
that
he
had
Lysa
flat
out
tell
the
Starks
that
the
Lannisters
did
it
Gradually
lead
Ned
to
discover
the
truth
about
Cersei
the
honorbound
Ned
Stark
will
predictably
make
a
direct
challenge
against
Cersei
when
he
finds
out
leading
to
civil
war
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
get
exhausted
in
a
mutually
destructive
civil
war
which
Littlefinger
manipulates
in
such
a
way
to
drag
it
out
as
long
as
possible
instead
of
a
quick
decisive
end
But
we
knew
all
of
this
already
mostly
Littlefinger
probably
caused
the
debt
crisis
so
he
can
bribe
off
noble
Houses
with
their
own
stolen
money
start
a
war
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
to
exhaust
them
both
Littlefinger
in
the
novels
says
he
wants
to
help
Sansa
retake
the
North
by
marrying
her
to
Harry
the
Heir
Sweetrobins
first
cousin
once
removed
and
closest
living
relative
the
Vale
which
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
kept
out
of
the
war
still
has
all
of
its
armies
at
full
strength
They
can
retake
the
North
from
the
Boltons
turning
on
the
Lannisters
in
the
process
who
are
a
spent
force
by
this
point
putting
Littlefinger
in
control
of
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
But
why
Yes
its
better
to
have
the
North
given
how
impossible
it
seemed
for
such
a
minor
nobleman
to
take
it
at
first
but
its
the
heart
of
winter
now
he
wont
get
any
money
from
it
lowhanging
fruit
I
guess
Not
sure
what
his
endgame
there
is
But
theres
one
big
point
I
hadnt
considered
In
all
probability
it
was
actually
Littlefinger
who
orchestrated
the
Riot
of
Kings
Landing
Later
in
the
novels
in
a
spare
moment
Jaime
ponders
if
maybe
Varys
started
the
riot
and
it
wasnt
random
at
all
He
wonders
this
because
Varys
just
fled
with
Tyrion
even
though
he
forced
him
to
but
because
Tyrion
killed
Tywin
and
Varys
aided
his
escape
etc
Jaime
is
particularly
concerned
with
Varyss
loyalty
Certainly
as
the
spymaster
he
had
the
means
to
orchestrate
such
a
riot
and
he
conspicuously
wasnt
at
the
docks
to
see
off
Myrcella
long
with
the
other
Small
Council
membersbut
now
I
think
this
was
misdirection
from
GRRM
The
book
version
of
the
riot
is
a
little
different
but
when
you
consider
what
happened
it
puts
everything
in
perspective
Littlefinger
had
already
left
the
city
to
conduct
negotiations
with
the
Tyrellsyet
in
Sansa
V
in
book
the
next
novel
he
mentions
in
passing
that
part
of
the
way
he
got
the
Tyrell
alliance
was
by
telling
them
how
desperate
conditions
were
in
the
capital
city
starving
without
food
from
the
Reach
and
thus
the
Lannisters
would
be
dependent
on
them
and
getting
the
shorter
end
of
the
deal
because
they
were
desperate
eager
to
give
them
concessions
And
in
Sansa
V
ASOS
he
mentions
that
some
of
his
men
told
them
the
gory
details
of
the
Riot
of
Kings
Landinghow
could
they
have
known
about
that
if
they
left
with
Littlefinger
before
the
riot
took
place
granted
some
of
them
may
have
followed
after
Littlefinger
later
onand
indeed
Littlefinger
didnt
even
need
to
be
IN
Kings
Landing
to
start
a
riot
But
this
confirms
that
some
of
his
many
agents
were
still
in
Kings
Landing
before
the
riot
and
then
had
specific
details
about
it
which
they
reported
to
the
Tyrells
Possibly
some
of
this
was
just
common
knowledge
but
still
the
implication
is
that
Littlefingers
entourage
would
have
left
the
city
as
a
group
Even
disregarding
that
consider
what
actually
happened
in
the
riot
Jaimes
guess
that
Varys
caused
it
is
vague
on
motivations
his
cousin
Tyrek
Lannister
disappeared
in
the
riot
and
he
was
Roberts
squire
along
with
Lancel
Jaime
wasnt
in
the
city
at
the
time
but
after
hes
informed
what
happens
begins
to
think
how
odd
it
is
for
a
man
to
disappear
theyd
sure
have
found
a
body
by
now
if
hed
simply
died
and
anyone
wanting
to
ransom
him
would
have
done
it
months
ago
Jaime
realizes
that
someone
kidnapped
Tyrek
probably
to
keep
him
alive
to
pump
information
out
of
him
a
kings
squire
often
overhears
a
lot
of
stuff
Moreover
Tyrek
years
old
was
proxymarried
to
the
baby
Ermesande
Hayford
sole
heir
to
House
Hayford
a
major
vassal
in
the
Crownlands
obviously
not
consummated
yet
just
to
seal
the
betrothal
so
anyone
controlling
Tyrek
could
try
to
control
the
Hayford
lands
So
thats
why
Jaime
began
to
suspect
that
someone
must
have
engineered
that
riot
yes
the
people
were
angry
but
someone
must
have
been
paid
to
throw
that
cowpie
and
spark
off
an
outrigh
triot
But
consider
some
of
the
major
results
of
that
riot
Tyrek
Lannister
is
kidnapped
whoever
holds
him
has
possible
info
from
Roberts
reign
as
well
as
claim
to
House
Hayford
The
High
Septon
is
torn
limb
from
limb
and
Littlefinger
had
earlier
mentioned
that
the
corrupt
High
Septon
was
being
difficult
to
deal
with
in
regards
to
the
debt
crisis
after
all
about
million
out
of
the
million
of
the
crowns
debts
were
owed
to
the
Faith
wouldnt
Littlefinger
want
to
remove
a
willful
competitor
The
replacement
High
Septon
was
considered
even
more
of
a
Lannister
lackey
Aron
Santagar
is
killed
held
down
and
his
head
smashed
in
with
cobblestones
In
the
novels
he
is
the
master
of
arms
at
the
Red
Keep
and
might
have
recognized
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
Littlefinger
falsely
said
was
Tyrions
to
the
point
that
Catelyn
sent
Rodrick
Cassel
out
to
show
it
to
him
and
ask
about
it
Killing
Santagar
would
remove
one
of
the
few
people
who
could
independently
confirm
or
recall
that
Tyrion
did
not
possess
that
dagger
anymore
Lollys
Stokeworth
is
gangraped
This
may
have
been
an
accident
But
in
the
novels
Littlefinger
is
going
to
frequent
dinners
held
by
the
Stokeworths
who
are
trying
to
push
off
Lollys
on
someone
So
Littlefinger
had
clear
interest
in
the
Stokeworths
in
the
novels
they
also
were
antiLannister
ballast
for
any
potential
push
into
the
Crownlands
having
hated
them
since
the
Sack
of
Kings
Landing
The
Stokeworths
are
fairly
wealth
control
a
large
portion
of
the
food
supply
to
the
capital
city
and
have
some
claim
to
House
Rosbys
lands
once
their
aging
lord
dies
Having
her
gangraped
would
make
it
less
likely
that
she
could
be
married
off
Moreover
one
of
the
other
suitors
to
Lollys
was
guess
who
Balon
Swann
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
of
the
Kingsguard
is
killed
in
the
riot
and
Balon
Swann
is
named
to
replace
him
meaning
that
Balon
can
no
longer
be
a
suitor
to
Lollys
and
the
Stokeworth
wealth
Sansa
Stark
is
nearly
carried
off
by
the
mob
presumably
to
rape
her
but
Sandor
Clegane
charges
in
and
saves
her
offscreen
in
the
novels
In
the
TV
series
version
due
to
economy
of
characters
it
is
Meryn
Trant
who
refuses
to
go
back
out
and
save
her
making
the
cowardly
excuse
that
hes
there
to
protect
Joffrey
and
Joffrey
didnt
tell
him
to
go
but
in
the
NOVELS
it
was
Mandon
Moore
who
refused
to
go
Thats
what
threw
me
I
forgot
that
it
was
Mandon
not
Meryn
in
the
novel
version
And
it
seems
likely
that
Mandon
Moore
was
actually
a
bought
agent
of
Littlefingers
Its
mentioned
that
Mandon
was
named
to
the
Kingsguard
at
Jon
Arryns
suggestion
and
Jon
Arryn
didnt
like
Mandonwhich
suggests
that
it
was
actually
Lysa
who
must
have
influenced
her
husband
to
name
Mandon
to
the
Kingsguard
at
Littlefingers
request
Later
on
of
course
Mandon
Moore
tries
to
kill
Tyrion
one
of
Littlefingers
major
rivals
and
we
never
find
out
why
in
the
novels
Even
in
the
TV
series
they
just
imply
and
assume
that
Joffrey
must
have
ordered
him
to
but
this
might
just
be
misdirection
Also
consider
that
Littlefinger
basically
owns
the
Gold
Cloaks
and
while
it
is
unlikely
that
any
would
be
willing
to
be
in
such
danger
even
if
paid
he
could
rather
easily
bribe
them
off
to
encourage
them
to
attack
the
crowd
at
Joffreys
orders
instead
of
just
running
away
or
waiting
for
confirmation
Couldnt
hurt
that
he
owns
the
Gold
Cloaks
and
might
have
been
a
factor
So
the
big
point
of
this
long
post
is
that
I
was
just
stunned
when
I
realized
that
all
signs
point
that
Littlefinger
and
not
Varys
probably
orchestrated
the
riot
of
Kings

Moral

Thats
what
Im
saying
If
you
want
to
conquer
the
world
best
have
dragons
and
all

So
if

control
her

thats

We
should
decide

Petyr

If
I
recall
we
had
this

problem
once

when
some

referred

Who
wrote
the
whole
part
on
his
personality
and
why
does
it
read
like
an
angry
high
school
paper
Seriously
it
reads
like
someone
who
hated
the
character
decided
to
project
a
bunch
of
negative
bias
onto
the
character
We
know
hes
a
villian
do
we
need
to
use
italics
to
stress
it
certain
words
to
really
hammer
it
home
The
whole
part
on
his
love
of
Cat
and
Sansa
is
mostly
OK
but
just
phrased
like
someone
was
venting

ironborn
isnt
capitalized
ironborn
is
not
supposed
to
be
capitalized
Granted
weve
made
this
mistake
a
lot
but
we
try
to
fix
it
when
we
see
itThe

July

Since
Ironborn
is
the
name
of
a
nationality
or
ethnicgroup
in
the
world
of
Game
of
Thrones
I
instinctively
spell
the
name
with
a
capital
letter
Im
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
with
nations
and
demographics
in
the
real
world
I
didnt
intend
to
vandalize
anyones
work
Fenrir
talk
July
UTC
Oh
its
not
vandalism
or
anything
I
made
this
mistake
for
a
long
time
when
I
was
first
on
here
Just
try
to
avoid
it
in
the
futureThe

Littlefinger
and
Arya
As
I
pointed
out
in
the
notes
for
that
Season
episode
Littlefinger
is
certainly
lying
to
Sansa
Harrenhal
just
fell
to
the
Starks
he
was
even
at
a
council
meeting
in
which
this
was
directly
stated
If
had
had
recognized
Arya
he
would
have
done
something
to
grab
her
into
his
control
before
she
was
seemingly
liberated
by
her
brother
and
mother
So
its
simply
a
lie
and
the
implication
is
that
he
didnt
recognize
Arya
otherwise
he
would
have
done
something
And
of
course
he
didnt
pass
through
Harrenhal
in
the
books
and
that
bit
of
pantomime
was
all
invented
for
the
TV
showThe
Dragon
Demands

February
UTC
I
was
referring
to
Baelishsmeeting
with
Catelynin
the
Stormlands
in
Season
But
then
erased
the
article
when
I
realized
I
had
placed
it
in
the
talk
section
for
Season
instead
of
Season
Fenrir
talk
February
UTC
Vote
for
new
Bureaucrats
The
Wikia
Staff
said
that
even
though
Werthead
is
stepping
down
voluntarily
we
need
to
have
an
open
vote
to
determine
who
will
now
be
promoted
to
Bureaucrat
status

Chaos
isnt

Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
refuse
They
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there

Petyr
Baelish
to
Varyssrc
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season

upon
his
arrival
in

for
aid

is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly

to
be
his
but

lost
it
in
a
bet
with

Eddard
assaulting

for

his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads

to

later
tells

about
how

has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when

was
young
for
stealing
a

over

Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros

later
introduces
Eddard
to

into
a
fight
with

flees
promising
to
return
with
the

Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later

tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on

a

from

at

expense
causes
the
seasoned

to
draw
his

departs
for
the
Vale
of
Arryn
Season
After
Joffreys
death
Dontos
Hollard
delivers
Sansa
Stark
to
Lord
Baelishs
ship
After
Sansa
climbs
aboard
Dontos
reminds
Lord
Baelish
about
his
payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and
crossbowmen
kill
Dontos
Baelish
takes
off
Sansas
necklace
which
he
made
himself
and
throws
it
overboard
landing
on
Dontos
body
Lysa
reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece
Alayne
pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven
the

which
led

his
death

Do

story
we
agree

tell

and
over

that
its
a
lie

But
what
do
we
have
left
once
we
abandon
the
lie
Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting
to
swallow
us
all
Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there

Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore

on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show

Petyr
Baelish
to

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
based
on
a
lie
to
weaken
the
Seven
Kingdoms
In

he
was
finally

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to
House
Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into
the
city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
Lord
Baelish
asks
the
Queen
to
allow
Sansa
Stark
to
prove
her
loyalty
as
he
attends
the
girls
audience

knowing
full
well
that

powerful
wife
than
Lysa
he

take
her
on

him

to

information
back

The
Vale
of

Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been
Ros
who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for

Stark
to

climbs
aboard

Baelish
about

payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and

kill
Dontos
Baelish
takes
off
Sansas
necklace
which
he
made
himself
and
throws
it
overboard
landing
on
Dontos
body
Lysa
reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece
Alayne
pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven
the

of
which
led
to
his
death

what

what
do
we
have
left
once
we
abandon
the
lie
Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting
to
swallow
us
all
Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love

Only
the
ladder
is

The
climb

all

is
Littlefinger

In

In
the
A
Song

novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and
crew
Petyr
Baelish
is
pronounced

Petyr

to

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
based
on
a
lie
to
weaken
the
Seven
Kingdoms
In
the
end
he
was
finally

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to

Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into

city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out

did
warn
you
not

trust
me

Baelish
asks

to

to
prove
her
loyalty
as

of
Joffreys
reign
are
read
out
and
Barristan
Selmys
position
is
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
Jaime
Lannister
a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as
Sansa
seeks
pardon
for
her
fathers
actions
Baelish
watches
on
as
Eddard
Stark
confesses
at
his
trial
and
is

with

confronts

responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the

scenario

that
they

to
the

where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to

Baelish
is

alone
with

him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at

her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into

them
immediately
and
says
that

slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new

the

led

his
death

Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore
videos
on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According

TV

Petyr

to

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the

Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under

influence
within

Stark

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to
House
Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into
the
city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
Lord
Baelish
asks
the
Queen
to
allow
Sansa
Stark
to
prove
her
loyalty
as
he
attends
the
girls
audience
with
the
Queen
and
the
council
He
stands
with
the
small
council
as
the
details
of
Joffreys
reign
are
read
out
and
Barristan
Selmys
position
is
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
Jaime
Lannister
a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as
Sansa
seeks
pardon
for
her
fathers
actions
Baelish
watches
on
as
Eddard
Stark
confesses
at
his
trial
and
is
executed
Littlefinger
discusses
kingship
with
Varys
and
they
engage
in
banter
revolving
around
the
Master
of
Whisperers
lack
of
genitalia
They
eventually
acknowledge
their
mutual
admiration
and
respect
of
one
another
before
being
interrupted
by
Joffrey
and
his
entourage

his
assistance
and
swears
him
to
secrecy
Pycelle
is
arrested
for
revealing
that
Tyrion
plans
to
wed
Myrcella
into
House
Martell
and
Littlefinger
realizes
that
he
was
involved
in
a
ruse
He
confronts
Tyrion
who
apologizes
and
offers
him
another
opportunity
to
act
as
an
envoy
to

to
propose
a
prisoner
exchange

bones
to
Catelyn

Catelyn
at

reception
from
Renly
but
nevertheless
offers
to
betray
the
Lannisters
and
open
the
gates
of
Kings
Landing
to
Renlys
army
He
takes
interest
in
Renlys
new
bride
Margaery
Tyrell
and
lets
Margaery
know
that
he
is
aware
that
it
is
a
purely
political
marriage
because
of
Renlys
homosexuality
He
meets
with
Catelyn
as
planned
and
delivers
Eddards
remains
as
a
sign
of
good
faith
She
greets
him
with
angry
recriminations
over
his
betrayal
of
Eddard
and
rejects
his
poorly
timed
advances
He
delivers
Tyrions
suggested
exchange
terms
Jaime
for
Sansa
and
Arya
Stark
Littlefinger
lies
that
the
Lannisters
have
Arya
in
their
custody
Renly
is
killed
in
mysterious
circumstances
and
Littlefinger
then
approaches
the
Tyrells
with
a
new
proposal
of
alliance
with
Joffrey
This
will
allow
Margaery
Tyrell
to
remain
a
queen
and
provide
Loras
Tyrell
vengeance
on
Stannis
He
leaves
the
camp
with
them
for
Highgarden
Catelyn
acts
alone
to
free

and
House
Tyrell
to
Lord

is
successful
in
negotiating
with
the
Tyrells
and
the
allied
forces
arrive
in
time
to
claim
victory
at
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
Littlefinger
is
elevated
to
Lord
of
Harrenhal
in
reward
for
brokering
the
alliance
He
jokes
that
now
he
must
get
started
on
producing
some
heirs
Sansas
betrothal
to
King
Joffrey
is
broken
so
that
Joffrey
can
marry
Margaery
Sansa
is
overjoyed
at
this
but
tries
to
look
heartbroken
Littlefinger
warns
Sansa
that
she
isnt
fooling
anyone
and
that
Joffrey
will
not
let
her
go
despite
setting
her
aside
Lord
Petyr
tells
her
that
she
reminds
him
of
Catelyn
and
offers
to
take
her
home
to
Winterfell
but
she
is
reluctant
to
trust
him
Season
Baelish
colludes
with
Sansa
Stark
that
he
plans
to
smuggle
her
out
of
the
city
on
his
ship
when
he
leaves
on
an
upcoming
mission
With
his
new
position
as
Lord
of
Harrenhal
Littlefingers
status
is
elevated
considerably
enough
for
him
to
leave
his
position
as
Master
of
Coin
to
Tyrion
purchase
a
ship
and
prepare
to
sail
to
the
Eyrie
with
a
marriage
proposal
to
the
widowed
Lysa
Arryn
However
knowing
full
well
that
Sansa
could
end
up
being
a
more
politically
powerful
wife
than
Lysa
he
plans
to
take
her
on
his
ship
with
him
Ros
now
secretly
working
for
Varys
discovers
his
intentions
and
informs
Varys
who
promptly
convinces
Lady
Olenna
Tyrell
to
arrange
a
marriage
between
Sansa
and
Loras
Having
been
asked
by
Cersei
to
collect
information
on
the
Tyrells
Littlefinger
orders
one
of
his
homosexual
prostitutes
Olyvar
to
act
as
Loras
squire
and
seduce
him
all
the
way
to
the
bedroom
He
does
so
and
manages
to
get
Loras
to
admit
to
the
secret
wedding
plans
Olyvar
relays
this
piece
of
information
back
to
Littlefinger
who
tests
Sansa
When
she
declines
her
place
on
his
ship
Baelish
realizes
Varys
plan
and
tips
off
Cersei
and
Tywin
Petyr
Baelish
sailing
to
the
The
Vale
of
Arryn
Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been
Ros
who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for
the
Vale
of
Arryn
Season
After
Joffreys
death
Dontos
Hollard
delivers
Sansa
Stark
to
Lord
Baelishs
ship
After
Sansa
climbs
aboard
Dontos
reminds
Lord
Baelish
about
his
payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and
crossbowmen
kill
Dontos
Baelish
takes
off
Sansas
necklace
which
he
made
himself
and
throws
it
overboard
landing
on
Dontos
body
Lysa
reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece
Alayne
pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven
the
last
of
which
led
to
his
death

Distrusting

You
know
what
I

I
learnt
that
Ill

Not
that

Thats
their
game
their
rules
Im
not
going
to
fight
them
Im
going
to
fuck
them
Thats
what
I
know

what
I
am
and
only
by
admitting
what
we
are
can
we
get
what
we
want
Ros
And
what
do
you
want
Petyr

Oh
everything

grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
major
talent
for
befriending
powerful
men
and
women
Petyr

A
useful
talent
Im
sure
youd
agree
Varys
and
Littlefingersrc
Those
who
have
the
most
power

the

better

story
we
agree
to
tell
each
other
over
and
over
until
we
forget
that
its
a
lie

But
what
do
we
have
left
once
we
abandon
the
lie
Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting
to
swallow
us
all
Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there
is
Littlefinger

Varyssrc
Always
keep
your
foes

So
many
men
they
risk
so
little
They
spend
their
lives
avoiding
danger
And
then
they
die

everything
to
get
what
I
want

on

Season

on

Season

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her

Littlefinger
is
still
alive

point
the

reached
Whereas
in
the

Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting

this
is
not
the

of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show

a
public

penance
in

History
Season
Cersei
prepares
for
her
Walk
of
atonement
After
being
caught
at
a
brothel
in
the
middle
of
a
session
of
blasphemous
sexual
roleplay
the
High
Septon
is
trapped
by
a
group
of
Sparrows
stripped
of
all
his
clothes
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Kings
Landing
while
one
of
the
Sparrows
publicly
names
him
a
sinner
and
beats
his
hands
to
keep
him
from
covering
his
genitalia
Cersei
endures
her
punishment
After
a
time
imprisoned
by
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
Queen
Cersei
confesses
to
having
committed
adultery
with
her
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
who
had
joined
the
Faith
Militant
and
accused
her
of
adultery
incest
and
regicide
The
High
Sparrow
informs
Cersei
that
she
will
still
be
tried
for
the
other
two
charges
that
she
denies
while
allowing
her
to
return
to
the
Red
Keep
only
if
she
performs
a
walk
of
atonement
as
penance
for
her
confessed
sin
Cerseis
hair
is
cut
short
and
then
she
is
presented
to
the
population
of
Kings
Landing
so
they
will
bear
witness
to
her
confession
and
penitence
She
is
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
made
to
walk
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
to
the
Red
Keep
escorted
by
members
of
the
Faith
Militant
who
keep
away
the
leering
and
jeering
crowds
who
have
gathered
to
see
her
shame
and
take
the
chance
to
insult
their
hated
Queen
Mother
As
she
walks
Septa
Unella
accompanies
her
repeatedly
crying
out
Shame
and
ringing
a
bell
to
attract
peoples
attention
Season
When
King
Tommen
Baratheon
becomes
loyal
to
the
faith
the
High
Sparrow
tells
him
that
his
wife
Margaery
Tyrell
must
perform
a
walk
of
atonement
He
is
reluctant
to
tell
his
mother
after
being
counseled
by
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
however
he
later
tells
Cersei
At
a
Small
Council
meeting
Cersei
informs
Olenna
Tyrell
that
Margaery
will
perform
her
walk
of
atonement
before
the
day
of
her
trial
and
they
both
agree
this
cannot
happen
However
at
the
Standoff
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
House
Tyrell
and
Jaime
Lannister
try
to
revert
it
The
High
Sparrow
then
concludes
that
Margaery
is
ultimately
spared
from
her
walk
as
she
is
already
repented
for
her
crimes
due
to
uncovering
House
Lannisters
treachery
against
the
sparrows
Tommen
then
agrees
to
an
alliance
with
the
High
Sparrow
symbolizing
the
union
of
the
crown
and
the
faith
When
Jaime
Lannister
is
formally
removed
from
the
Kingsguard
for
threatening
the
Faith
he
sarcastically
asks
if
he
will
be
forced
to
make
a
walk
of
atonement
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
it
seems
that
walks
of
atonement
are
civil
punishments
used
to
publicly
shame
women
accused
of
adultery
or
prostitution
It
also
serves
as
a
means
of
degrading
these
women
and
stripping
them
of
whatever
pride
or
power
they
might
hold
The
novels
mention
only
two
people
who
had
to
go
through
this
humiliating
punishment
Tytos
Lannisters
mistress
and
Cersei
Tywin
Lannister
forced
his
fathers
mistress
to
make
a
walk
of
atonement
after
Lord
Tytos
died
While
it
is
common
for
widowed
lords
to
take
lowborn
women
as
bedwarmers
Tytoss
mistress
a
woman
scarcely
one
step
above
a
prostitute
had
come
to
dominate
him
utterly
she
was
seated
beside
him
in
the
hall
showered
with
gifts
and
honors
and
even
asked
for
her
views
on
matters
of
state
She
stole
from
him
issued
orders
to
the
household
knights
dismissed
servants
and
helped
herself
to
the
jewelry
of
the
late
Lady
Jeyne
Tytoss
wife
She
grew
so
influential
that
it
was
said
around
Lannisport
that
any
man
who
wished
for
his
petition
to
be
heard
should
kneel
before
her
and
speak
loudly
to
her
lap
for
Lord
Tytoss
ear
was
between
his
ladys
legs
Lord
Tytos
died
of
a
heart
attack
while
climbing
stairs
to
his
mistress
and
the
first
thing
Tywin
did
on
his
return
from
Kings
Landing
was
to
expel
her
from
Casterly
Rock
All
the
selfseekers
who
had
named
themselves
her
friends
and
cultivated
her
favor
abandoned
her
The
silks
and
velvets
Tytos
had
lavished
on
her
were
taken
away
as
was
the
jewelry
she
had
appropriated
Tywin
had
her
stripped
and
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
of
Lannisport
to
the
docks
for
a
fortnight
telling
everyone
she
met
that
she
was
a
thief
and
a
whore
Though
no
man
laid
a
hand
on
her
that
walk
spelled
the
end
of
her
power
Cersei
was
too
young
to
witness
the
spectacle
herself
but
heard
the
stories
from
washerwomen
and
guardsmen
who
had
been
there
Although
Cerseis
uncle
Kevan
Lannister
disapproved
of
many
of
her
deeds
her
incestuous
affair
with
Jaime
corrupting
Lancel
spoiling
Joffrey
and
her
poor
conduct
as
the
Queen
Regent
he
does
not
gloat
at
Cersei
but
feels
sorry
for
her
public
humiliation
He
muses
sadly
that
Tywin
would
have
never
dreamed
that
the
same
degrading
punishment
he
gave
their
fathers
mistress
would
be
imposed
on
his
own
daughter
In
the
novels
when
Cersei
is
shorn
the
septas
remove
all
of
her
body
hair
her
eyebrows
pubic
hair
even
scraping
the
rest
of
her
body
They
shave
her
head
completely
bald
In
the
TV
episode
the
septas
prominently
produce
a
razor
blade
as
if
they
are
going
to
shave
her
but
curiously
does
not
use
it
at
all
One
septa
separately
picks
up
a
pair
of
shears
and
cuts
Cerseis
luxurious
long
golden
hair
off
but
crops
it
close
to
her
head
instead
of
shaving
her
bald
entirely
In
her
subsequent
nude
scenes
the
rest
of
her
body
hair
isnt
shaved
While

hallucinates

queen
who

cast
Cersei
down
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
Cerseis
walk
of
atonement
is
loosely
based
on
what
happened
to
Jane
Shore
the
mistress
of
King
Edward
IV
of
England
Like
Robert
Baratheon
Edward
was
a
great
warrior
who
won
the
crown
on
the
battlefield
in
his
youth
but
became
fat
and
illsuited
to
rule
in
later
life
After
Edward
died
his
brother
Richard
III
usurped
the
throne
ahead
of
Edwards
sons
He
deeply
resented
Jane
so
he
had
her
arrested
and
made
her
perform
a
penance
walk
a
common
punishment
for
harlotry
Jane
did
not
perform
the
penance
walk
naked
however
but
had
to
walk
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
London
wearing
only
her
kirtle
petticoat
which
at
the
time
was
still
said
to
have
gained
significant
male
attention
the
main
source
of
the
humiliation
was
that
this
was
a
punishment
normally
meted
out
to
harlots
Martin
has
said
that
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
one
of
the
major
inspirations
for
his
novels
the
conflict
was
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
while
in
Westeros
the
conflict
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
clearly
named
after
the
real
families

traveling

a

so
I
didnt

at

I
was

engrossed

the

I
enjoyed
it
I
was
mildly
annoyed
by
the
timeline
but
enjoyed
the
story
elements
enough
I
was
willing
to
overlook
it
Characters
were
zipping
around
so
absurdly
fast
that
it
broke
the
realism
of
the
story
so
I
didnt
find
it
dramatically
satsifying
I
honestly
didnt
care
about
the

issues
but
the

didnt
make
a

Janos
Slynt
about
to
kill
the
baby
Barra
Lord
Janos
has
been
given
a
place
in
the
small
council
During
a
session
that
coincides
with
King
Joffrey
Baratheons
sixteenth
nameday
and
the
official
announcement
of
the
end
of
the
longest
summer
in
living
memory
he
expresses
his
concern
with
the
influx
of
refugees
fleeing
the
civil
war
He
is
ordered
by
Queen
Regent
Cersei
Lannister
to
bar
the
city
gates
to
peasants
Later
Janos
oversees
the
massacre
of
all
of
the
late
King
Robert
Baratheons
bastard
children
He
personally
murders
the
baby
Barra
before
the
eyes
of
her
mother
Mhaegen
one
of
Littlefingers
prostitutes
He
also
interrogates
Tobho
Mott
who
is
being
tortured
by
one
of
the
gold
cloaks
about
the
whereabouts
of
Gendry
and
learns
that
he
has
left
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
and
is
heading
to
Castle
Black
Janos
sends
a
small
party
of
men
after
Gendry
Lord
Janos
is
told
of
his
fate
Janos
is
present
at
a
small
council
meeting
when
they
receive
a
request
for
more
men
from
Lord
Commander
Jeor
Mormont
of
the
Nights
Watch
Tyrion
later
has
Janos
as
a
dinner
guest
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
Tyrion
dismisses
his
squire
Podrick
Payne
after
Janos
begins
to
chastise
the
boy
for
spilling
wine
on
his
hand
The
two
exchange
compliments
and
jokes
Tyrion
asks
about
the
incident
in
Petyrs
brothel
which
Janos
calls
a
nasty
business
but
necessary
Tyrion
feigns
agreement
saying
that
the
peace
must
be
kept
However
the
discussion
quickly
turns
sour
when
Tyrion
brings
up
the
subject
of
Janoss
role
in
the
murder
of
Roberts
bastards
subtly
accusing
him
of
taking
bribes
from
Cersei
or
Joffrey
to
carry
out
such
a
horrific
crime
though
Janos
defends
his
position
and
hints
that
it
was
not
Cersei
who
gave
him
the
order
He
also
defends
himself
for
betraying
Eddard
to
the
usurpers
claiming
Eddard
was
a
traitor
who
tried
to
buy
him
though
Tyrion
counters
that
Slynt
had
already
been
bought
by
Littlefinger
and
the
Lannisters
and
accuses
him
outright
of
lacking
in
honor
At
this
point
Slynt
stands
up
and
threatens
Tyrion
but
is
interrupted
by
Bronn
whom
Tyrion
claims
is
the
new
Lord
Commander
of
the
City
Watch
Over
Slynts
protests
and
threats
that
he
has
friends
at
court
who
will
not
stand
for
this
Tyrion
has
four
gold
cloaks
seize
Slynt
informing
him
that
he
does
not

him
and
is
sending
him
to

Janos

at

He
joins

to
listen
Jon

it
is
unexplained
how
Slynt
was
immediately

to
join
the
panel
Slynt
is
dismissive
of
Jons
claims
referring
to
Jon
as
the
bastard
son
of
a
traitor
and
argues
for
his
execution
When
Jon
asks
him
if
he
has
ever

of
the
Wall
he
boasts
that
he
commanded

grows
angered
when
Jon
sarcastically
retorts
he
must
have
been
bad
at

job
to
have
been
sent
to
the
Wall
Slynt
clearly
does
not
believe
Jons
report
as
he
laughs
at
his
claims
of
giants
in
the

is

is
later
present
when
Jon
urges

to

forces
During
the
Battle
of

Janos
accompanies
Alliser
Thorne
atop
the

and
oversees
the
defenses
When
Alliser
leaves
the
Wall
to
help
the
black
brothers
under
attack
by
wildlings
from
the
south
he
leaves
Janos
in
charge
of
the

defenses
Janos
having
no
true
leadership
experience
begins
to
break
down
at
the
sight
of

and

wildling

Grenn
steps
in
by
falsely
claiming
that
Alliser
needs
Janos

down
in

either
believes
him
or
pretends
to

a
pretext
to
flee
allowing
Jon
to
take

Once
down
below
Janos
locks
himself
in
the
kitchens
where

discovers

mocks
him
for
his

retaliates
by
revealing
how

cowered
in
fear
in
the
larder
of
Castle

with
Gilly
and
her
baby
prompting
everyone
in
the
room
to
laugh
at
Janos
while
he
denounces

claims
as
lies
Jon
ultimately
wins
the
election
Janos
right
before
he
is
executed
by
Jon
Snow
Small
justice
for
Ned
Stark
During
a
meeting
as
Jon
assigns
missions
to
various
black
brothers
Janos
pats
Thorne
on
the
shoulder
when
Jon
names
him
First
Ranger
When
Jon
assigns
Janos
to
take
command
of
the
castle
of
Greyguard
he
rudely
refuses
before
Jon
is
even
finished
speaking
The
Lord
Commander
clarifies
that
this
is
official
command
not
an
offer
but
Janos
further
insults
Jon
telling
him
that
he
can
stick
his
order
up
his
bastard
arse
Calmly
Jon
orders
Janos
to
be
taken
outside
and
calls
for
his
sword
At
first
Janos
is
dragged
out
to
the
courtyard
believing
that
this
is
simply
a
scare
tactic
but
he
realizes
his
mistake
when
Eddison
Tollett
forces
him
down
onto
the
chopping
block
Terrified
Janos
begs
for
Jon
to
give
him
another
chance
admitting
that
he
was
wrong
to
question
him
and
that
he
has
been
afraid
for
a
long
time
and
breaks
into
tears
His
pleas
for
mercy
are
ultimately
futile
and
Jon
beheads
Janos
with
Longclaw
exacting
a
small
justice
for
the
deceased
Ned
Stark
as
well
as
the
Stark
guardsmen
who
were
slaughtered
in
the
throne
room
and
King
Roberts
murdered
bastard
children
Personality
Janos
Slynt
was
a
disgraceful
arrogant
and
corrupt
man
who
would
commit
any
action
given
to
him
by
the
king
or
queen
without
hesitation
without
remorse
and
without
honor
While
he
claims
to
be
a
loyal
and
faithful
servant
of
the
King
and
his
main
priority
would
be
to
defend
the
city
and
serve
the
king
Janoss
true
drive
appears
to
be
to
obtain
power
through
political
positions
and
abuse
such
power
to
dominate
his
command
over
others
by
the
use
of
immoral
and
cruel
means
and
later
defend
such
actions
by
stating
they
were
justified
in
the
name
of
the
king
or
otherwise
Amongst
other
things
he
accepts
solicited
bribes
from
criminals
and
other
members
of
the
City
Watch
Janos
naturally
enjoys
authoritative
positions
having
found
himself
in
them
his
entire
life
including
Lord
Commander
of
the
City
Watch
member
of
the
Small
Council
head
of
House
Slynt
and
an
unspecified
highranking
position
in
the
Nights
Watch
However
this
is
more
of
a
compliment
to
his
ability
to
squirm
his
way
into
the
favor
of
other
people
with
highranking
positions
by
blind
obedience
and
being
outwardly
sycophantic
rather
than
his
own
accommodations
Janos
is
not
above
treachery
or
hypocrisy
at
times
He
would
never
have
risked
his
position
by
doing
the
honorable
thing
and
helping
Eddard
Stark
remove
Joffrey
Baratheon
from
power
instead
he
betrays
Eddard
and
his
men
on
the
spot
and
defends
this
to
Tyrion
Lannister
by
saying
he
was
a
traitor
who
attempted
to
buy
him
off
ignoring
that
he
was
already
bought
off
by
Petyr
Baelish
in
the
first
place
A
common
mistake
Janos
usually
makes
is
believing
himself
an
important
or
valued
necessity
whilst
he
is
usually
disregarded
altogether
When
being
exiled
to
the
Nights
Watch
he
proclaims
he
has
powerful
friends
who
would
be
upset
about
this
but
in
reality
no
one
appeared
concerned
over
Janoss
exile
He
uses
this
excuse
again
when
about
to
be
executed
unaware
that
Tywin
Lannister
was
dead
and
he
was
making
empty
threats
Finally
when
Jon
Snow
gives
the
order
of
Janoss
executions
he
stands
staunchly
as
Alliser
Thorne
seemingly
defends
him
only
to
be
shocked
when
Thorne
moves
aside
and
lets
them
have
their
way
with
him
Beneath
his
confident
and
defiant
exterior
Janos
is
actually
a
coward
While
other
Lord
Commanders
of
the
City
Watch
are
either
knights
or
have
some
knowledge
of
the
battlefield
he
possesses
none
of
the
sort
and
prefers
attacking
those
who
cannot
fight
back
including
Lord
Eddards
defenseless
soldiers
in
the
Throne
Room
and
Barra
one
of
Roberts
bastards
who
was
only
a
baby
His
cowardice
is
displayed
during
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
where
he
hides
with
the
women
and
children
and
when
finally
realizing
Jon
was
serious
about
executing
him
breaks
down
in
tears
begging
and
claiming

been
afraid

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Janos
Slynt
was
a
commoner
a
butchers
son
who
joined
the
City
Watch
and
rose
through
the
ranks
first
to
captain
of
the
Iron
Gate
and
then
to
become
its
commander
at
the
death
of
the
former
commander
Manly
Stokeworth
The
City
Watch
or
Gold
Cloaks
is
one
of
the
few
institutions
in
Westeros
to
permit
promotion
of
nonnobles
from
the
ranks
He
is
a
somewhat
humorless
man
who
is
arrogant
and
proud
of
his
achievements
He
is
bald
stout
and
heavily
jowled
often
described
as
frogfaced
and
shaped
like
a
keg
He
is
the
father
of
Morros
Jothos
Danos
and
a
daughter
Arya
Stark
sees
Janos
Slynt
at
the
Sept
of
Baelor
throw
her
father
down
on
his
knees
for
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
to
behead
him
and
later
triumphantly
holds
Neds
head
up
for
all
to
see
Tywin
Lannister
is
indignant
that
he
was
raised
to
Lord
of
Harrenhal
due
to
his
low
birth
and
Harrenhal
having
been
the
seat
of
a
King
He
vows
that
Slynt
will
never
take
up
his
seat
if
he
has
any
part
in
it
Slynts
elevation
is
one
of
the
many
questionable
decisions
by
Cersei
and
Joffrey
that
prompts
Tywin
to
send
Tyrion
to
Kings
Landing
to
be
acting
Hand
and
rein
them
in
When
confronted
about
Slynts
appointment
Cersei
admits
to
Tyrion
that
Slynt
is
not
as
competent
as
could
be
wished
as
he
was
stupid
enough
to
believe
he
could
arrest
as
skilled
a
knight
as
Barristan
Selmywith
only
two
mennot
thinking
that
Selmy
might
choose
to
fight
rather
than
come
quietly
The
books
also
establish
that
Slynt
had
amassed
wealth
by
taking
bribes
selling
positions
and
selling
promotions
By
the
end
of
his
tenure
over
half
the
officers
were
paying
him
part
of
their
salaries
Jon
Arryn
discovered
this
and
had
two
men
who
were
willing
to
come
forward
to
testify
against
Janos
but
both
were
found
dead
a
short
time
later
Jon
still
wanted
to
dismiss
Slynt
but
King
Robert
preferred
a
known
thief
over
someone
who
might
be
worse
According
to
Stannis
Baratheon
these
were
Littlefingers
words
which
Robert
was
merely
repeating
Littlefinger
managed
to
successfully
convince
Robert
that
Janos
was
no
worse
than
past
Commanders
who
took
bribes
now
and
again
when
he
was
in
fact
one
of
the
most
corrupt
in
the
history
of
the
City
Watch
according
to
Stannis
outright
selling
positions
and
promotions
in
the
City
Watch
is
actually
very
unusual
even
in
their
jaded
history
Stannis
also
believes
that
Littlefinger
not
only
knew
of
Slynts
corruption
but
also
made
sure
the
crown
profited
from
it
Janos
was
probably
on
Littlefingers
direct
payroll
for
years
though
at
what
point
he
sided
exclusively
with
Littlefinger
is
difficult
to
say
Stannis
also
comments
that
were
he
King
Slynt
would
have
lost
more
than
his
position
for
such
corruption
If
Janos
wasnt
already
an
active
agent
for
Littlefinger
as
soon
as
Robert
died
he
certainly
sided
with
Littlefinger
in
the
coup
against
Ned
Stark
simply
for
more
bribes
Littlefinger
seems
to
have
been
laying
the
groundwork
of
his
schemes
for
years
buying
out
men
in
positions
of
authority
in
the
capital
Sansa
deeply
hates
Slynt
remembering
how
he
had
thrown
down
her
father
for
Ilyn
Payne
to
behead
She
wishes
she
could
hurt
him
or
that
some
hero
would
throw
him
down
and
cut
off
his
head
When
she
hears
Tyrion
sends
him
to
the
Wall
she
carelessly
says
in
Joffreys
presence
I
hope
the
Others
get
him
and
gets
beaten
In
A
Clash
of
Kings
Janos
doesnt
personally
kill
Barra
but
instead
sends
one
of
his
subordinates
Allar
Deem
Tyrion
is
still
disgusted
with
Slynt
as
he
is
in
the
TV
series
because
he
happily
passed
on
the
orders
to
a
man
under
his
command
and
was
thus
ultimately
responsible
for
it
Deem
is
exiled
to
the
Wall
with
Slynt
though
Tyrion
gives
orders
for
Deem
to
be
killed
and
thrown
overboard
before
he
arrives
In
A
Storm
of
SwordsTywin
receives
the
distress
message
from
Castle
Black
and
is
angered
by
the
opening
sentence
To
the
five
kings
In
order
to
teach
the
Nights
Watch
who
is
their
only
lawful
kingand
bring
them
under
his
control
he
decides
to
force
them
to
choose
for
a
new
Lord
Commander
whoever
he
tells
them
too
otherwise
they
will
receive
no
reinforcements
Pycelle
agrees
with
Tywin
and
suggests
Slynt
for
the
office
Tyrion
objects
knowing
that
Slynt
is
a
very
poor
choice
for
a
Lord
Commander
he
reminds
his
father
that
the
black
brothers
choose
their
own
commander
and
Slynt
isa
hollow
suit
of
armor
who
will
sell
himself
to
the
highest
bidder
a
very
accurate
description
of
Slynt
but
his
protests
fall
on
deaf
ears
Lord
Slynt
is
not
present
during
most
of
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
He
arrives
with
his
crony
Alliser
Thorne
at
very
late
stage
of
the
battle
both
of
them
contributing
nothing
to
the
battle
only
interfering
They
seize
command
on
the
castle
and
interrogate
Jon
roughly
They
accuse
him
of
oathbreaking
cowardice
and
desertion
Maester
Aemon
assures
them
that
Jon
has
already
explained
his
deeds
to
him
and
Donal
Noye
but
they
either
do
not
believe
or
do
not
care
Jon
repeats
what
he
told
before
that
he
was
acting
at
Qhorins
orders
but
his
explanations
are
rejected
Slynt
taunts
Jon
by
claiming
that
Eddard
Stark
died
a
traitor
Hearing
the
lies
about
his
father
Jons
patience
runs
out
and
he
attacks
Thorne
The
Eastwatch
men
pull
Jon
off
Thorne
and
he
is
locked
in
an
ice
cell
Four
days
later
he
is
released
as
Aemon
in
that
time
has
rallied
several
senior
members
of
the
Nights
Watch
to
testify
to
Jons
loyalty
preventing
Slynt
and
Thorne
from
executing
him
Slynt
and
Thorne
order
Jon
Snow
to
go
to
Mance
Rayder
under
the
pretext
of
parley
and
assassinate
him
Jon
knows
well
that
the
wildlings
will
probably
kill
him
on
the
spot
but
he
has
no
other
choice
but
to
do
as
told
knowing
that
a
refusal
will
confirm
the
false
accusations
against
him
and
give
Thorne
and
Slynt
an
excuse
to
kill
him
Jon
also
grudgingly
acknowledges
that
the
plan
to
assassinate
Mance
at
the
cost
of
his
own
life
is
the
only
viable
plan
they
have
left
for
saving
the
Nights
Watch
though
ultimately
his
meeting
with
Mance
is
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Stannis
Baratheons
army
Slynt
puts
himself
forth
as
candidate
to
succeedJeor
MormontasLord
Commander
of
the
Nights
Watch
with
the
support
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
and
later
on
ofBowen
Marshas
wellSlynt
also
tries
to
persuadeStannis
Baratheonto
support
him
but
Stanniss
personal
dislike
for
Slynt
over
his
corruption
scandal
and
his
distaste
for
the
mans
sycophantic
flattery
put
an
end
to
it
he
describes
Slynts
vile
deeds
in
details
putting
Slynt
in
the
worst
possible
light
he
can
but
comments
that
if
Slynt
is
chosen
he
will
accept
thatDue
to
the
rivalry
betweenCotter
Pykeand
SerDenys
Mallister
Slynts
chances
improve
In
the
end
he
is
defeated
by
the
efforts
of
Samwell
Tarly
who
persuades
Pyke
and
Mallister
to
support
Jon
Snow
as
a
compromise
candidate
After
being
chosen
Jon
knows
he
must
deal
with
Slynt
and
Thorne
who
have
done
their
best
to
get
him
killed
for
they
will
undoubtedly
undermine
him
Jon
knows
about
Slynts
part
in
his
fathers
downfall
but
suppresses
his
personal
feelings
reminding
himself
that
whenever
someone
joins
the
Watch
his
criminal
record
is
erased
clean
He
decides
to
send
Slynt
away
and
keep
Thorne
the
more
dangerous
of
the
two
close
to
him
Jon
orders
Slynt
to
leave
and
take
command
of
Greyguard
but
Slynt
refuses
his
direct
order
three
times
both
in
private
and
in
public
in
an
extremely
obnoxious
and
disrespectful
manner
Initially
Jon
was
going
to
have
him
hanged
but
then
commands
his
men
to
bring
him
down
only
to
reveal
that
he
meant
that
hanging
him
was
wrong
because
his
father
taught
him
that
the
man
who
passes
the
sentence
must
swing
the
sword
Desperately
Slynt
claims
that
he
has
friends
in
Kings
Landing
unaware
that
those
friends
are
either
dead
stripped
of
power
or
simply
do
not
care
about
him
Jon
then
personally
beheads
Janos
unknowingly
fulfilling
Sansas
wish
which
perhaps
has
been
a
foreshadowing
of
Slynts
fate
Ned
Starks
own
son
beheading
Janos
has
one
more
layer
of
narrative
resonance
in
the
novels
though
the
TV
show
doesnt
show
it
in
the
books
Janos
not
only
betrayed
Ned
to
his
eventual
death
but
after
Ilyn
Payne
beheaded
Ned
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept
Janos
personally
lifted
up
Neds
severed
head
by
the
hair
and
proudly
held
it
up
to
display
it
to
the
crowd
even
as
Neds
blood
splattered
out
of
it
onto
the
steps
It
is
unclear
whether
Slynts
death
has
anything
to
do
with
the
curse
of
Harrenhal
which
has
not
been
confirmed
yet
and
can
be
dismissed
as
a
superstition
it
has
allegedly
harmed
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
all
of
whom
have
been
physically
present
at
the
castle
and
served
as
its
castellans
Slynt
however
never
set
his
foot
at
Harrenhal
ever
since
he
received
the
lord
title

The
TV
series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is

are
filmed
at

the

is

The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are

larger

were
that

much
larger

the

Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humansrefhttpwwwhbogocomseriesvideoassetIDGOROSTGPvideoModeembeddedVideoshowSpecialFeaturestrue

The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three

five
hours
for

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
WikipediaSasquatchSasquatch
Bigfoot
or
WikipediaYetiYeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
considered
to
be
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans

large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent

The

thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

HistoryEdit
According
to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk
believe
he
used
magic
to
enslave
them
Season
Edit
While
visiting
at
Castle
Black
Tyrion
Lannister
tells
Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Edit
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of

While
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
as
giants
are
very
shy
but
that
their
shyness
can
quickly
turn
into
rage
She
told
him
how
she
once
saw
a
giant
smash
a
man
straight
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
Season
Edit
Following
Jon
Snows
betrayal
and
flight
from
the
wildlings
he
reports
back
to
Castle
Blacks
remaining
leadership
that
Mance
Rayder
is
advancing
on
their
position
with
an
army
strong
and
that
he
has
united
the
Thenns
Hornfoots
and
the
Iceriver
clans
and
he
even
has
giants
marching
with
him
Janos
Slynt
breaks
out
laughing
as
south
of
the
Wall
giants
are
just
a
creature
from
stories
to
frighten
children
but
he
stops
when
he
sees
that
the
other
Nights
Watch
officers
such
as
Alliser
Thorne
and
Maester
Aemon
arent
laughing
but
are
apparently
willing
to
give
some
credence
to
Jon
if
he
says
he
saw
giants
with
his
own
eyes
During
the
Battle
of
Castle
Black
several
giants
go
into
battle
against
the
Nights
Watch
along
with
the
Free
Folk
They
shoot
large
arrows
at
the
watchers
on
top
of
the
Wall
and
use
a
mammoth
to
try
and
break
down
the

to
get
into
the
tunnel
leading
to
Castle
Black
but
is
killed
by
a

of
black
brothers
led
by
Grenn
As
the
night
ends
with
the
wildlings
momentarily
retreating
Jon
remarks
to
Samwell
Tarly
that
among
the
army
of
nearly
wildlings
that
Mance
has
amassed
there
might
be
hundreds
of
Giants
Season
Edit
At
Hardhome
Wun
Weg
Wun
Dar
Wun
is
the
only
known
giant
residing
in
the
wildling
settlement
Inside
the
large
keep
he
was
seen
looking
at
the
dragonglass
dagger
and
later
got
annoyed
when
Dolorous
Edd
stares
at
him
for
too
long
When
a
horde
of
wights
and
White
Walkers
under
theNight
King
attack
Wun
Wun
joined
in
the
defense
as
he
easily
defeats
many
wights
before
covering
the
escape
of
Jon
Snow
Tormund
and
the
few
remaining
defenders
with
a
burning
log
from
the
overwhelming
enemy
as
he
walks
into
the
sea
with
them
and
the
fleet
of
ships
boarded
by
wildling
refugees
Arriving
at
the
Wall
Wun
Wun
and
the
few
thousand
wildlings
were
allowed
safe
passage
to
settle
in
the
Gift
although
the
black
brothers
of
the
Nights
Watch
were
intimidated
at
the
sight
of
Wun
Wun
as
they
have
never
seen
a
giant
before
Season
Edit
When
Jon
Snow
is
later
assassinated
Wun
Wun
and
the
wildlings
are
summoned
back
to
Castle
Black
to
deal
with
the
mutineers
Wun
Wun
breaks
down
the
gate
at
Castle
Black
and
easily
intimidates
them
into
surrendering
killing
only
one
mutineer
after
he
foolishly
and
futilely
shot
the
giant
in
the
back
with
a
crossbow
He
later
agrees
to
help
a
resurrected
Jon
Snow
in
his
forthcoming
battle
against
Ramsay
Bolton
Wun
Wun
participates
in
the
battle
and
is
inundated
with
dozens
of
arrows
and
pierced
by
spears
He
falls
to
his
knees
before
being
shot
in
the
eye
by
Ramsay
after
breaching
Winterfell
It
is
unknown
whether
there
are
even
a
few
remaining
living
Giants
left
beyond
the
Wall
as
the
White
Walkers
are
seemingly
destroying
every
last
Free
Folk
stronghold
so
it
is
possible
that
with
Wun
Wuns
death
the
Giants
are
completely
extinct
Season
Edit
Surrounded
by
a
snowstorm
undead
giants
are

finale
two
large

within
the

Behind
the
scenesEdit
The
giant
costumes
are
actually
full
body
foam
suits
which
have
to
be
assembled
around
the
actors
By
the
end
of
Season
only
two
of
these
expensive
suits
have
been
produced
for
the
giants
Dongo
who
first
appeared
in
Season
played
by
Ian
Whyte
and
Mag
the
Mighty
played
by
Neil
Fingleton
Taller
people
and
creatures
physically
walk
with
a
different
gait
and
heft
than
smaller
ones
due
to
the
mechanics
of
their
extra
weight
simply
using
CGI
greenscreen
effects
to
make
an
averagesized
stuntman
appear
feet
tall
doesnt
realistically
capture
the
mechanics
of
how
a
giant
person
would
actually
move
The
TV
series
cast
two
of
the
tallest
stuntmen
in
the
UK
and
with
the
height
added
from
the
full
costume
they
stood
a
little
less
than
eight
feet
tall
giants
in
the
narrative
are
inhumanly
tall
however
around
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
They
were
then
scaledup
using
CGI
from
nearly
eight
feet
to
over
twelve
feet
high
and
their
motions
were
therefore
more
authentic
for
such
tall
beings
than
digitally
scaling
up
a
five
and
a
half
foot
tall
stuntman
Other
subtle
camera
tricks
were
used
to
try
to
make
the
weight
and
heft
of
their
motions
actually
match
a
twelve
foot
tall
giant
the
camera
speed
for
the
giants
is
very
slightly
slowed
down
to
make
their
movements
seem
more
weighty
Normal
footage
is
filmed
at
frames
per
second
but
giants
are
filmed
at
frames
per
second
after
which
the
footage
is
played
back
at
the
regular
frames
per
second
making
them
appear
slightly
slower
The
simple
technique
was
also
used
of
mostly
filming
the
giants
with
the
camera
pointing
up
at
them
as
if
from
a
regular
humans
vantage
point
instead
of
too
many
shots
of
looking
down
at
them
from
the
Wall
Moreover
their
costumes
were
actually
designed
to
be
disproportionately
larger
at
the
bottom
of
their
legs
than
they
are
at
the
top
at
their
heads
which
combined
with
the
camera
angles
makes
a
forcedperspective
shot
creating
the
impression
that
they
are
even
larger
Other
techniques
were
that
the
giants
head
prosthetics
are
much
larger
than
the
actors
actual
heads
underneath
even
the
giants
hands
seen
onscreen
are
actually
oversized
gloves
that
fit
over
the
already
very
large
stuntmens
hands
Costume
Designer
Michele
Clapton
explained
her
approach
to
creating
the
clothing
of
the
Giants
I
always
think
giants
in
costume
look
really
corny
I
wanted
their
upbringing
to
be
different
as
if
as
children
they
were
swaddled
and
wrapped
in
anything
And
so
on
when
they
get
bigger
they
just
keep
wrapping
and
wrapping
and
wrapping
By
the
time
they
get
to
this
age
theyre
just
massively
wrapped
in
fabrics
and
antlers
and
bones
and
grass
So
the
wrapping
isnt
clothes
as
we
know
them
its
protection
For
me
thats
what
differentiates
them
from
the
wildling
humans

Mammoths
and
Giants
Joe

Supervisor
The
giants
were
first
developed
in
Season
The
best
decision
was
to
use
unusually
tall
performers
to
give
a
sense
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
giants
movement
Ian
Whyte
measures
in
at
around
seven
feet
one
inch
in
height
He
is
a
wellknown
suit
performer
in
the
UK
and
he
had
been
our
giant
before
in
Season
as
well
as
a
White
Walker
in
Season
Production
then
found
Neil
Fingleton
the
tallest
man
in
the
UK
who
in
his
suit
comes
in
around
seven
feet
eleven
inches
We
also
slowed
down
the
speed
onscreen
a
tiny
amount
In
terms
of
design
the
idea
was
that
we
would
always
be
looking
up
at
them
so
the
costumes
were
deliberately
made
smaller
at
the
top
with
big
tree
trunk
legs
at
the
bottom
Barry
Gower
Prosthetics
Supervisor
To
get
the
suit
we
begin
by
making
a
fullbody
cast
Then
a
fabricator
created
the
suit
by
layering
and
piecing
reticulated
foam
into
a
creation
that
could
actually
be
zipped
up
For
Neil
Fingletons
suit
we
sewed
in
a
set
of
his
own
shoes
for
comfort
The
costumes
team
then
dressed
the
foam
suit
but
we
still
needed
to
create
a
new
silicon
prosthetic
headpiece
for
the
second
giant
Mag
which
was
designed
from
scratch
The
head
alone
was
several
kilos
so
they
are
carrying
a
great
deal
of
weight
when
they
move
I
think
this
might
help
with
the
lumbering
Prosthetics
alone
takes
three
hours
of
application
for
the
heads
We
were
eventually
able
to
get
down
to
around
oneandahalf
hours
so
with
hair
and
costume
the
process
could
take
between
three
and
five
hours
for
each
of
our
giants
In
the
booksEdit
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
giants
have
a
drastically
different
more
apelike
appearance
They
tend
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
a
very
tall
human
about
to
feet
in
height
but
not
monstrously
huge
A
single
giant
is
as
strong
as
a
dozen
humans
They
generally
resemble
descriptions
of
the
Sasquatch
Bigfoot
or
Yeti
They
wear
no
clothing
but
instead
are
covered
in
shaggy
fur
pelts
which
are
thicker
below
the
waist
The
fur
of
older
giants
becomes
grey
and
streaked
with
white
Their
heads
are
thrust
forward
from
their
shoulder
blades
but
they
have
very
short
necks
They
have
squashedin
faces
with
square
teeth
and
tiny
eyes
amidst
folds
of
flesh
Their
eyesight
is
poor
and
they
snuffle
constantly
smelling
as
much
as
they
see
They
have
sloped
chests
and
their
lower
torsos
are
about
half
again
as
wide
as
their
upper
torsos
Their
arms
hang
lower
than
a
mans
while
their
legs
are
shorter
than
their
arms
ending
in
splayed
feet
that
need
no
shoes
even
in
the
coldest
weather
The
female
giants
look
similar
to
the
men
Giants
are
generally
not
considered
to
be
as
intelligent
as
the
average
human
though
they
are
sapient
and
capable
of
speech
They
speak
the
Old
Tongue
of
the
First
Men
The
giants
are
physically
capable
of
speaking
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
and
can
learn
it
after
instruction
its
just
that
the
giants
live
so
far
to
the
north
away
from
the
Wall
that
they
havent
really
encountered
the
Common
Tongue
before
The
giants
do
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
advanced
society
or
culture
barely
possessing
the
most
primitive
Stone
Age
technology
They
make
and
wear
no
clothing
because
their
pelts
adequately
provide
all
the
protection
they
need
They
do
not
generally
possess
technology
more
advanced
than
simply
grabbing
a
large
tree
log
and
wielding
it
as
a
club
Some
of
them
however
are
smart
enough
to
tie
large
stone
boulders
to
the
end
of
the
tree
logs
to
make
crude
mauls
On
a
few
occasions
these
are
even
sharpened
to
form
basic
stone
axes
The
giants
ride
huge
mammoths
as
their
steeds
The
giants
possess
little
if
any
largescale
political
structure
they
do
not
have
kings
though
particularly
large
old
and
experienced
giants
who
are
veteran
warriors
often
seem
to
act
as
basic
chieftans
or
warband
leaders
A
particularly
large
silverback
giant
named
Mag
Mar
Tun
Doh
Weg
is
the
prominent
ringleader
of
the
giants
in
Mance
Rayders
army
The
giants
inhabit
the
far
northern
regions
of
the
lands
beyond
the
Wall
where
humans
will
not
encroach
on
them
perilously
close
to
the
Lands
of
Always
Winter
They
once
roamed
all
of
Westeros
but
were
pushed
further
and
further
north
when
the
First
Men
migrated
to
the
continent
starting
twelve
thousand
years
ago
In
the
present
day
they
are
almost
extinct
even
beyond
the
Wall
by
the
time
Mance
Rayder
unified
all
of
the
wildlings
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
giants
remaining
Giants
are
considered
entirely
mythical
south
of
the
Wall
Jon
Snow
recalls
that
in
the
nursery
stories
and
fables
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
giants
were
basically
just
big
people
who
lived
in
big
castles
dressed
in
armor
like
knights
and
were
ruled
by
lords
and
ladies
Jon
is
surprised
when
he
discovers
that
giants
survive
north
of
the
Wall
not
simply
due
to
their
existence
but
because
they
do
not
match
the
legends
he
has
heard
but
are
far
more
grounded
and
crude
This
matches
author
George
RR
Martins
intent
with
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
to
deconstruct
the
literary
tropes
of
High
Fantasy
literature
in
which
numerous
different
nonhuman
races
such
as
dwarves
or
elves
are
actively
involved
in
the
world
Instead
nonhuman
races
are
so
rare
in
Westeros
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
just
the
stuff
of
legends
However
even
when
Martin
actually
does
start
introducing
nonhuman
races
with
the
giants
they
are
much
more
realistic
and
dirty
than
the
kind
of
fantasy
tropes
that
even
Jon
Snow
was
expecting
Jon
sums
up
his
assessment
of
the
giants
by
noting
that
they
actually
kind
of
remind
him
of
Hodor
the
mentally
challenged
and
incredibly
tall
stableboy
at
Winterfell
Rather
Jon
notes
giants
are
about
twice
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
about
half
as
intelligent
though
unlike
Hodor
they
can
speak
a
full
language

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his

Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at

he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the

Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in

to
gain
some
influence
within

Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard

Jon

This
was
what
effectively
began
the

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued

who
tried

have
her

is
able
to
answer
this
quickly

brothel
he
thinks

is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to

cause
giving

knows
about

discomfort

and

verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the

that

has
been
meeting
with

Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of

Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have

assassinated
before

later
introduces

return
with

Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later

tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while

holds

dagger
to
Eddards
throat

a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his

and
toss
it
at
the

suspiciously
at

actions

confesses
at

circumstances
and

Stark
that
he
plans
to
smuggle
her
out

on
his
ship
when
he
leaves
on
an
upcoming
mission
With
his
new
position
as

of

a
ship
and
prepare
to
sail
to
the
Eyrie
with
a

proposal
to

However
knowing
full
well
that

could
end
up
being
a
more
politically
powerful
wife
than
Lysa
he
plans
to
take
her
on
his
ship
with
him
Ros
now
secretly
working
for

discovers
his
intentions
and
informs

who
promptly
convinces

to
arrange

to
collect
information
on

Littlefinger
orders
one
of
his
homosexual
prostitutes
Olyvar
to
act
as
Loras
squire
and
seduce
him
all
the
way
to
the
bedroom
He
does
so
and
manages
to
get

to
admit
to
the
secret
wedding
plans
Olyvar
relays
this
piece
of
information
back
to
Littlefinger
who
tests

When
she
declines
her
place
on

plan
and
tips
off
Cersei
and
Tywin
Petyr
Baelish
sailing
to
the
The
Vale
of
Arryn
Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been
Ros
who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for
the
Vale
of
Arryn
Season
After

death
Dontos
Hollard
delivers

Stark
to

Baelishs
ship

climbs
aboard

reminds

Baelish
about

payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and
crossbowmen
kill
Dontos

it
overboard
landing

reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece

pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven

of
which
led
to
his
death

Chaos

Baelish
Chaos

Chaos

ladder
Many

climb
it
fail

The
fall
breaks
them
And
some

climb

they
refuse
they
cling

Only
the

Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and

Petyr
Baelish
is

Chaos

Chaos
is

Many
who

it
fail

never

to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a

to

refuse
They

Petyr
Baelish
to

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
based
on
a
lie
to
weaken
the
Seven
Kingdoms
In
the

he
was

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in

of

brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor

and
Varys
converse
in
the

Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another

Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while

holds

dagger
to
Eddards

a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as

for
her

actions

watches
on
as

Stark
confesses
at

his
new
position
as
Lord
of
Harrenhal
Littlefingers
status
is
elevated
considerably
enough
for
him
to
leave
his
position
as
Master
of
Coin
to
Tyrion
purchase
a
ship
and
prepare
to
sail
to
the
Eyrie
with
a
marriage
proposal
to
the
widowed
Lysa
Arryn
However
knowing
full
well
that
Sansa
could
end
up
being
a
more
politically
powerful
wife
than
Lysa
he
plans
to
take
her
on
his
ship
with
him
Ros
now
secretly
working
for
Varys
discovers
his
intentions
and
informs
Varys
who
promptly
convinces
Lady
Olenna
Tyrell
to
arrange
a
marriage
between
Sansa
and
Loras
Having
been
asked
by
Cersei
to
collect
information
on
the
Tyrells
Littlefinger
orders
one
of
his
homosexual
prostitutes
Olyvar
to
act
as
Loras
squire
and
seduce
him
all
the
way
to
the
bedroom
He
does
so
and
manages
to
get
Loras
to
admit
to
the
secret
wedding
plans
Olyvar
relays
this
piece
of
information
back
to
Littlefinger
who
tests
Sansa
When
she
declines
her
place
on
his
ship
Baelish
realizes
Varys
plan
and
tips
off
Cersei
and
Tywin
Petyr
Baelish
sailing
to
the
The
Vale
of
Arryn
Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been
Ros
who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for
the
Vale
of
Arryn
Season
After
Joffreys
death
Dontos
Hollard
delivers
Sansa
Stark
to
Lord
Baelishs
ship
After
Sansa
climbs
aboard
Dontos
reminds
Lord
Baelish
about
his
payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and
crossbowmen
kill
Dontos
Baelish
takes
off
Sansas
necklace
which
he
made
himself
and
throws
it
overboard
landing
on
Dontos
body
Lysa
reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece
Alayne
pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed

of
which
led
to
his
death

Quotes
Spoken
by
Littlefinger
Distrusting
me
was
the
wisest
thing
youve
done
since
you
climbed
off
your
horse
Littlefinger
to
Eddard
Starksrc
When
you
find
yourself
in
bed
with
an
ugly
woman
best
close
your
eyes
get
it
over
with
Cut
her
throat
Be
done
with
it
Littlefinger
about
Robert
Baratheons
proposal
of
killing
Daenerys
Targaryensrc
Ros
What
she
doesnt
know
wont
hurt
her
Petyr
Baelish
A
stupid
saying
What
we
dont
know
is
usually
what
get
us
killed
Ros
and
Littlefingersrc
Petyr
Baelish
You
know
what
I
learnt
losing
that
duel
I
learnt
that
Ill
never
win
Not
that
way
Thats
their
game
their
rules
Im
not
going
to
fight
them
Im
going
to
fuck
them
Thats
what
I
know
thats
what
I
am
and
only
by
admitting
what
we
are
can
we
get
what
we
want
Ros
And
what
do
you
want
Petyr
Baelish
Oh
everything
my
dear
Everything
there
is
Littlefinger
and
Rossrc
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
Littlefinger
betrays
Eddard
Starksrc
Varys
I
admire
you
Lord
Baelish
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
major
talent
for
befriending
powerful
men
and
women
Petyr
Baelish
A
useful
talent
Im
sure
youd
agree
Varys
and
Littlefingersrc
Those
who
have
the
most
power
have
the
least
grace
Littlefinger
to
Rossrc
Look
around
you
were
all
liars
here
and
every
one
of
us
is
better
than
you
Littlefinger
to
Sansa
Starksrc
Petyr
Baelish
Do
you
know
what
the
realm
is
Its
the
thousand
blades
of
Aegons
enemies
a
story
we
agree
to
tell
each
other
over
and
over
until
we
forget
that
its
a
lie
Varys
But
what
do
we
have
left
once
we
abandon
the
lie
Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting
to
swallow
us
all
Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there
is
Littlefinger
and
Varyssrc
Always
keep
your
foes
confused
If
they
dont
know
who
you
are
or
what
you
want
they
cant
know
what
you
plan
to
do
next
Littlefinger
to
Sansasrc
I
dont
want
friends
like
me
Littlefinger
to
Sansasrc
Littlefinger
So
many
men
they
risk
so
little
They
spend
their
lives
avoiding
danger
And
then
they
die
Id
risk
everything
to
get
what
I
want
Sansa
And
what
do
you
want
Littlefinger
Everything
Littlefinger
and
Sansasrc
Sansa
Stark
Why
did
you
really
kill
Joffrey
Tell
me
why
Petyr
Baelish
I
loved
your
mother
more
than
you
could
ever
know
Given
the
opportunity
what
do
we
do
to
those
whove
hurt
the
ones
we
love
In
a
better
world
one
where
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
you
might
have
been
my
child
But
we
dont
live
in
that
world
Youre
more
beautiful
than
she
ever
was
Sansa

Baelish

Call
me
Petyr
Littlefinger
explains
his
warped
motivations
and
skewed
worldview
to
Sansa
after
which
he
holds
the
side
of
her
face
and
gives
her
a
long
romantic
kiss
on
the
lipssrc
Oh
my
sweet
wife
My
sweet
silly
wife
I
have
only
loved
one
woman
only
one

entire

Your

last
words

Lysa

pushing
her
through
the
moon

People
die
at
their
dinner

They

in
their
beds
They

over

Everybody
dies
sooner
or
later
And
dont
worry
about
your
death
Worry
about
your
life
Take
charge
of
your
life
for
as
long
as
it
lasts
Littlefinger
giving
advice
to
Robin
Arrynsrc
Theres
no
justice
in
this
world
not
unless
we
make
it
You
loved
your
family
avenge
them
Littlefinger

Sansasrc
We
both
peddle
fantasies
Brother
Lancel
Mine
just
happen
to
be
entertaining
Littlefinger
to
Lancelsrc
Every
time
Im
faced
with
a
decision
I
close
my
eyes
and
see
the
same
picture
Whenever
I
consider
a
question
I
ask
myself
Will
this
action
make
this
picture
a
reality
pull
it
out
of
my
mind
and
into
the
worldand
I
only
act
if
the
answer
is
yes
A
picture
of
me
on
the
Iron
Throne

you
by
my
side
Petyr

finally
reveals
his
true
goal

Petyr
Baelish
News
of
this
battle
will
spread
quickly
through
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Ive
declared
for
House
Stark
for
all
to
hear
Sansa
Stark
Youve
declared
for
other
Houses
before
Lord
Baelish
but
its
never
stopped
you
from
serving
yourself
Petyr
Baelish
The
past
is
gone
for
good
You
can
sit
here
mourning
its
departure
or
you
can
prepare
for
the
future
You
my
love
are
the
future
of
House
Stark
Who
should
the
North
rally
behind
A
trueborn
daughter
of
Ned
and
Catelyn
Stark
born
here
at
Winterfell
Or
a
motherless
bastard
born
in
the
South
Petyr
Baelish
sows
seeds
of
distrust
between
Sansa
Stark
and
Jon
Snowsrc
Dont
fight
in
the
North
or
the
South
Fight
every
battle
everywhere
always
in
your
mind
Everyone
is
your
enemy
everyone
is
your
friend
Every
possible
series
of
events
is
happening
all
at
once
Live
that
way
and
nothing
will
surprise
you
Everything
that
happens
will
be
something
that
youve
seen
before
Petyr

Starksrc
Spoken
toabout
Littlefinger
I
dont
like
you
Lord
Baelish
I
dont
like
your
face
I
dont
like
the
words
that
come
oozing
out
of
your
mouth
I
dont
want
you
in
my
tent
one
minute
more
than
necessary
So
tell
me
Why
are
you
here
Renly

Littlefingersrc
Is
there
an
idiot
in
any
village

trusts
Littlefinger

would

Hes
not
a

getting
something
back
Sansas
opinion
of
Littlefingersrc
Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore
videos
on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for

and

Petyr

Petyr

to

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of

based
on

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to
House
Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into
the
city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion

Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later

tells
him
the

of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them

of

reign
are
read
out
and

Selmys

is
ordered
to

a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his

and
toss
it
at
the
kings

suspiciously
at

as

for

confesses
at

of

Stark
that
he
plans
to
smuggle
her
out

on
his
ship
when
he
leaves
on
an
upcoming
mission
With
his
new
position
as
Lord
of

status
is
elevated
considerably

a
ship
and
prepare
to

to
the
Eyrie
with
a

proposal
to

Lysa
Arryn
However
knowing
full
well
that

could
end
up
being
a
more
politically
powerful
wife
than
Lysa
he
plans
to
take
her
on
his
ship
with
him
Ros
now
secretly
working
for
Varys
discovers
his
intentions
and
informs

who
promptly
convinces

Tyrell
to
arrange
a
marriage
between

been
asked
by

to
collect
information
on

Littlefinger
orders
one
of
his
homosexual
prostitutes
Olyvar
to
act
as
Loras
squire
and
seduce
him
all
the
way
to
the
bedroom
He
does
so
and
manages
to
get

to
admit
to
the
secret
wedding
plans
Olyvar
relays
this
piece
of
information
back
to
Littlefinger
who
tests

The
Vale
of
Arryn
Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been
Ros
who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for
the
Vale
of
Arryn
Season
After
Joffreys
death
Dontos
Hollard
delivers
Sansa
Stark
to
Lord
Baelishs
ship

climbs
aboard
Dontos
reminds
Lord
Baelish
about
his
payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and
crossbowmen
kill
Dontos
Baelish
takes
off
Sansas
necklace
which
he
made
himself
and
throws
it
overboard
landing
on
Dontos
body
Lysa
reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece

pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne

oath
to
Catelyn

keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven
the
last
of
which
led
to
his
death

useful
talent
Im

Those

But
what
do
we
have
left
once
we
abandon
the
lie
Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting
to
swallow
us
all
Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there
is
Littlefinger

Varyssrc
Always
keep
your
foes
confused
If

So
many
men
they
risk
so
little
They
spend
their
lives
avoiding
danger
And
then
they
die

risk
everything
to
get
what
I
want

what
do

In

In

A
Song

novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According
to
the
TV
series

pronunciation

developed
for

and

Petyr
Baelish
to
Varyssrc
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
based
on
a
lie
to
weaken
the
Seven
Kingdoms
In
the
end
he
was
finally
exposed
and
he
was
executed

small
area
within

a

region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies

on
money

search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in

has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past

by

a
whore

up
against
a
wall
before

appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster

believes
that

is
still
in

Riverlands
and
when

also
orders

himself
at

to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes

reminds

that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies

disagrees
asking

is
not
the
king

mature
into
the

cause

Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece
Alayne
pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new

Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore
videos
on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According

TV
series

The
Free
Folk
believe
giants
were
enslaved
with
magic
to
get
them
to
build
the
Wall
Giants
are
a
nonhuman
race
considered
to
be
legendary
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
south
of
the
Wall
However
for
many
years
wildlings
have
claimed
that
they
actually
exist
in
the
furthest
north
Beyond
the
Wall
This
is
in
contrast
with
both
the
Children
of
the
Forest
and
the
White
Walkers
which
even
the
wildlings
claim
to
have
not
seen
in

to
legend
Bran
the
Builder
enlisted
the
aid
of
giants
to
raise
the
Wall
The
Free
Folk

he
used

to
enslave
them
Season
While

Benjen
Stark
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
giants
and
ghouls
and
White
Walkers
are
lurking
beyond
the
Wall
Osha
asks
Bran
Stark
if
the
unusually
tall
Hodor
has
some
giants
blood
in
him
after
seeing
him
naked
Osha
insists
that
Giants
actually
do
exist
north
of
the
Wall
Season
Maester
Luwin
tells
Bran
Stark
that
many
people
think
that
magical
creatures
like
the
Giants
never
existed
at
all
Luwin
tells
Bran
that
he
thinks
they
may
have
once
existed
in
ancient
times
but
that
they
have
long
since
gone
extinct
the
dragons
are
gone
the
Giants
are
dead
and
the
Children
of
the
Forest
forgotten

the
camp
of
the
Free
Folk
with
Ygritte
Jon
Snow
sees
a
giant
working
Ygritte
tells
Jon
not
to
stare
She
tells
him
how
a
giant
once
smashed
a
man
into
the
ground
like
a
hammer
to
a
nail
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice

novels
Giants
have
a
more
apelike
appearance
They
wear
no
clothing
instead
they
are

fur
pelts
like

Petyr
Baelish
to
Varyssrc
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
based
on
a
lie
to
weaken
the
Seven
Kingdoms
In
the
end
he
was
finally
exposed
and
he
was
executed
for

War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to
House
Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into
the
city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me

Baelish
asks

to

to
prove
her
loyalty
as

the
girls

stands
with

of
Joffreys
reign
are
read
out
and
Barristan
Selmys
position
is
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
Jaime
Lannister
a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as
Sansa
seeks
pardon
for
her
fathers
actions
Baelish
watches
on
as
Eddard
Stark
confesses
at
his
trial
and
is

telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos

counters
him
by

Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of

murder
was
to

immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new

led

his
death

Petyr

A
useful
talent
Im
sure
youd
agree

Those

Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting

swallow

Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there
is
Littlefinger
and
Varyssrc
Always
keep
your
foes
confused
If
they

you

So
many
men

so
little
They
spend
their
lives
avoiding
danger
And
then
they
die
Id
risk
everything
to
get
what
I
want

And
what
do

Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore
videos
on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the

Because
of
his

with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the

To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under

within

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to
House
Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into
the
city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
Lord
Baelish
asks
the
Queen
to
allow
Sansa
Stark
to
prove
her
loyalty
as
he
attends
the
girls
audience
with
the
Queen
and
the
council
He
stands
with
the
small
council
as
the
details
of
Joffreys
reign
are
read
out
and
Barristan
Selmys
position
is
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
Jaime
Lannister
a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as
Sansa
seeks
pardon
for
her
fathers
actions
Baelish
watches
on
as
Eddard
Stark
confesses
at
his
trial
and
is
executed
Littlefinger
discusses
kingship
with
Varys
and
they
engage
in
banter
revolving
around
the
Master
of
Whisperers
lack
of
genitalia
They
eventually
acknowledge
their
mutual
admiration
and
respect
of
one
another
before
being
interrupted
by
Joffrey
and
his
entourage
Season
The
Citadel
announces
the

and

a
violent
reprimand
when
Cersei
tells

then
says
she

mind
in

and
lets
Margaery
know
that
he
is
aware
that

is
a

because
of

killed
in
mysterious
circumstances
and
Littlefinger
then
approaches
the
Tyrells
with
a
new
proposal
of
alliance
with
Joffrey
This
will
allow

He
jokes
that
now
he
must
get
started
on
producing
some
heirs

betrothal
to
King
Joffrey
is
broken
so
that

Sansa
is
overjoyed
at
this
but
tries

Littlefinger
warns
Sansa
that
she
isnt
fooling
anyone
and
that
Joffrey
will
not
let
her
go
despite
setting
her
aside
Lord
Petyr
tells
her
that
she
reminds
him
of
Catelyn
and
offers
to
take
her
home
to
Winterfell
but
she
is
reluctant
to
trust
him
Season
Baelish
colludes
with
Sansa
Stark
that
he
plans
to
smuggle
her
out
of
the
city
on
his
ship
when
he
leaves
on
an
upcoming
mission
With
his
new
position
as
Lord
of
Harrenhal
Littlefingers
status
is
elevated
considerably
enough
for
him
to
leave
his
position
as
Master
of
Coin
to
Tyrion
purchase
a
ship
and
prepare
to
sail
to
the
Eyrie
with
a
marriage
proposal
to
the
widowed
Lysa
Arryn
However
knowing
full
well
that
Sansa
could
end
up
being
a
more
politically
powerful
wife
than
Lysa
he
plans
to
take
her
on
his
ship
with
him
Ros
now
secretly
working
for
Varys
discovers
his
intentions
and
informs
Varys
who
promptly
convinces
Lady
Olenna
Tyrell
to
arrange
a
marriage
between
Sansa
and
Loras
Having
been
asked
by
Cersei
to
collect
information
on
the
Tyrells
Littlefinger
orders
one
of
his
homosexual
prostitutes
Olyvar
to
act
as
Loras
squire
and
seduce
him
all
the
way
to
the
bedroom
He
does
so
and
manages
to
get
Loras
to
admit
to
the
secret
wedding
plans
Olyvar
relays
this
piece
of
information
back
to
Littlefinger
who
tests
Sansa
When
she
declines
her
place
on
his
ship
Baelish
realizes
Varys
plan
and
tips
off
Cersei
and
Tywin
Petyr
Baelish
sailing
to
the
The
Vale
of
Arryn
Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been
Ros
who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for
the
Vale
of
Arryn
Season
After
Joffreys
death
Dontos
Hollard
delivers
Sansa
Stark
to
Lord
Baelishs
ship
After
Sansa
climbs
aboard
Dontos
reminds
Lord
Baelish
about
his
payment
Baelish
snaps
his
fingers
and
crossbowmen
kill
Dontos
Baelish
takes
off
Sansas
necklace
which
he
made
himself
and
throws
it
overboard
landing
on
Dontos
body
Lysa
reminds
Petyr
she
killed
her
husband
at
his
behest
Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his
niece
Alayne
pass
the
Bloody
Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the

a

warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven
the
last
of
which
led
to
his
death

Distrusting

You
know
what
I

duel
I
learnt
that
Ill
never

Not
that
way
Thats
their
game
their
rules
Im
not
going
to
fight
them
Im
going
to
fuck
them
Thats
what
I
know
thats
what
I
am
and
only
by
admitting
what
we
are
can
we
get
what
we
want
Ros
And
what
do
you
want
Petyr
Baelish
Oh
everything

Everything
there
is

admire
you

grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
major
talent
for
befriending
powerful
men
and
women
Petyr
Baelish
A
useful
talent
Im
sure
youd
agree
Varys
and
Littlefingersrc
Those
who
have
the
most
power

the

grace

Look
around

is
better

Do
you

story
we
agree
to
tell
each
other
over
and
over
until
we
forget
that
its
a
lie

But
what
do
we
have
left
once
we
abandon
the
lie
Chaos
a
gaping
pit
waiting
to
swallow
us
all
Petyr
Baelish
Chaos
isnt
a
pit
Chaos
is
a
ladder
Many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again
The
fall
breaks
them
And
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb
but
they
refuse
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love
Illusions
Only
the
ladder
is
real
The
climb
is
all
there
is
Littlefinger
and
Varyssrc
Always
keep
your
foes
confused
If
they

So
many
men
they
risk
so
little
They
spend
their
lives
avoiding
danger
And
then
they
die
Id
risk
everything
to
get
what
I
want

what
do

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends

time

and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale

neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has

three
of

Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few

Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and

Petyr
Baelish
is

Lord
Petyr
Baelish
popularly
called
Littlefinger
was
the
Master
of
Coin
on
the
Small
Council
under
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
He
was
a
skilled
manipulator
and
used
his
ownership
of
brothels
in
Kings
Landing
to
both
accrue
intelligence
on
political
rivals
and
acquire
vast
wealth
Baelishs
spy
network
is
eclipsed
only
by
that
of
his
archrival
Varys
After
marrying
Lady
Lysa
Tully
widow
of
Lord
Jon
Arryn
of
the
Vale
and
her
subsequent
death
at
his
hand
he
became
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
Because
of
his
relationship
with
her
Baelish
was
able
to
heavily
influence
Lysas
son
Robin
Arryn
the
new
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Vale
To
further
his
goal
of
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
Baelish
took
Sansa
Stark
under
his
wing
in
order
to
gain
some
influence
within
House
Stark
but
his
role
in
the
deaths
of
Eddard
Stark
Jon
Arryn
and
Lysa
Arryn
This
was
what
effectively
began
the
War
of

based
on

Biography
Background
Petyrs
father
left
befriends
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
head
of
House
Baelish
and
the
lord
of
an
extremely
minor
holding
so
small
it
has
neither
name
nor
a
maester
located
in
a
small
area
within
the
Fingers
a
coastal
region
in
the
northeastern
shores
of
the
Vale
of
Arryn
He
is
currently
the
only
living
member
of
House
Baelish
House
Baelish
had
very
meager
origins
and
no
distinguished
lineage
Petyrs
greatgrandfather
was
a
lowly
sellsword
from
Braavos
who
came
to
the
Vale
at
the
invitation
of
House
Corbray
Petyrs
grandfather
was
a
poor
hedge
knight
who
managed
to
earn
a
minor
lordship
of
a
few
stony
acres
in
the
smallest
peninsula
of
the
Fingers
Petyrs
father
fought
in
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
the
preemptive
assault
on
the
forces
of
Maelys
Blackfyre
the
last
of
the
Blackfyre
Pretenders
before
they
could
attempt
an
invasion
of
Westeros
During
the
conflict
Petyrs
father
served
well
under
Lord
Hoster
Tully
Through
their
good
relationship
Hoster
agreed
to
foster
his
son
Petyr
at
Riverrun
a
great
honor
for
a
lesser
House
Petyr
went
to
Riverrun
when
he
was
eight
years
old
carrying
all
he
owned
in
a
bundle
At
Riverrun
he
befriended
Hosters
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Tully
Their
brother
Edmure
mockingly
nicknamed
him
Littlefinger
in
reference
to
his
small
height
at
the
time
and
the
location
of
his
minor
landholdings
The
nickname
would
stick
with
him
throughout
his
life
Eventually
even
Petyr
sarcastically
embraced
the
nickname
because
it
showed
how
far
he
had
risen
from
an
impoverished
nobleborn
boy
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
officials
at
the
royal
court
Petyrs
failed
attempt
to
win
Catelyns
hand
Petyr
became
smitten
with
Catelyn
but
she
never
returned
his
affections
Lysa
was
infatuated
with
Petyr
but
he
only
loved
Catelyn
Eventually
when
she
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
heir
to
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Lord
Paramount
of
the
North
Petyr
challenged
him
to
a
duel
thinking
he
could
win
through
pluck
and
courage
but
he
was
promptly
overpowered
and
nearly
killed
though
Catelyn
begged
Brandon
to
spare
his
life
Embittered
Petyr
was
cast
out
of
Riverrun
and
returned
to
the
Vale
During
the
course
of
Roberts
Rebellion
however
Brandon
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
so
Catelyn
married
his
younger
brother
Eddard
Stark
while
to
secure
a
political
alliance
Lysa
was
wed
to
Jon
Arryn
ruler
of
the
Vale
Manipulating
Lysas
infatuation
with
himself
Petyr
ingratiated
himself
into
Jons
services
first
as
customs
officer
at
Gulltown
where
he
increased
the
ports
revenues
tenfold
Seeing
Littlefingers
financial
acumen
Jon
was
easily
convinced
by
Lysa
to
later
bring
Littlefinger
to
the
royal
court
at
Kings
Landing
and
make
him
Master
of
Coin
on
King
Robert
Baratheons
Small
Council
Petyrs
naked
ambition
often
placed
him
at
odds
with
the
Master
of
Whisperers
Varys
In
charge
of
the
crowns
treasury
Littlefinger
rapidly
grew
into
a
powerful
player
in
royal
politics
and
a
master
of
court
intrigues
Of
an
older
mindset
few
who
did
not
know
him
suspected
Littlefinger
as
a
threat
seeing
only
that
he
was
a
man
from
a
very
minor
House
with
no
distinguished
lineage
significant
landholdings
or
armies
Instead
Littlefinger
based
his
newfound
power
on
money
Baelish
is
unscrupulous
in
his
search
for
power
and
wealth
he
has
bought
multiple
brothels
in
the
city
Particularly
a
high
class
brothel
catering
to
the
nobles
in
the
city
cynically
noting
that
whores
make
a
better
investment
than
ships
because
they
rarely
sink
Baelish
makes
good
use
of
his
brothels
to
have
his
agents
spy
on
and
manipulate
his
clientele
and
owns
one
of
the
largest
spy
networks
in
Westeros
second
only
to
Varyss
Littlefinger
has
been
known
to
privately
bribe
lords
who
have
unusual
or
violent
sexual
fetishes
if
they
pay
the
right
price
ranging
from
supplying
lords
with
amputee
prostitutes
to
delivering
young
boys
to
pederasts
and
even
delivering
prostitutes
to
be
secretly
murdered
by
his
clients
for
thrillkills
Due
to
their
past
friendship
as
children
Catelyn
Stark
continued
to
believe
that
Lord
Baelish
was
a
friend
she
could
count
on
at
court
Season
Littlefinger
greets
Eddard
upon
his
arrival
in
Kings
Landing
and
reports
that
the
realm
is
six
million
gold
dragons
in
debt
half
of
it
owed
to
House
Lannister
Catelyn
Stark
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
attempt
to
sneak
into

city
but
are
spotted
by
one
of
Littlefingers
men
They
are
taken
to
meet
Littlefinger
at
one
of
his
brothels
Catelyn
is
angered
by
their
treatment
but
asks
Littlefinger
for
aid
She
is
trying
to
identify
the
people
who
tried
to
have
her
son
Bran
Stark
killed
Littlefinger
is
able
to
answer
this
quickly
the
elaborate
dagger
wielded
by
the
assassin
used
to
be
his
but
he
lost
it
in
a
bet
with
Tyrion
Lannister
Eddard
assaulting
Petyr
for
saying
his
wife
is
in
this
brothel
Littlefinger
fetches
Eddard
to
meet
his
wife
but
when
Eddard
realizes
he
was
being
brought
to
a
brothel
he
thinks
Littlefinger
is
insulting
him
by
saying
his
wife
is
a
whore
Eddard
throws
Littlefinger
up
against
a
wall
before
Catelyn
appears
and
Eddard
becomes
pacified
After
hearing
her
news
he
vows
to
find
the
truth
and
expose
the
Lannisters
to
Robert
and
Littlefinger
agrees
to
be
his
ally
in
this
for
the
affection
he
once
bore
Catelyn
as
a
youngster
Eddard
believes
that
Littlefinger
is
still
in
love
with
his
wife
Littlefinger
attaches
himself
more
firmly
to
Eddards
cause
giving
him
information
that
leads
Eddard
to
Tobho
Motts
smithy
He
also
points
out
some
of
the
agents
belonging
to
the
Queen
and
to
Varys
He
later
tells
Sansa
Stark
about
how
Sandor
Clegane
has
his
face
burned
by
his
brother
when
he
was
young
for
stealing
a
toy
He
advises
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
Sandor
Baelish
and
Varys
converse
in
the
Red
Keep
Littlefinger
loses
a
bet
to
Renly
Baratheon
over
the
joust
between
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
He
makes
it
clear
that
he
knows
about
Renlys
sexual
relationship
with
Loras
to
Renlys
discomfort
Littlefinger
and
Varys
verbally
spar
Littlefinger
threatening
to
reveal
to
the
King
that
Varys
has
been
meeting
with
Illyrio
Mopatis
in
secret
while
Varys
threatens
to
reveal
to
the
Lannisters
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
implicated
Tyrion
in
the
attempted
murder
of
Bran
Stark
However
they
then
both
support
the
motion
to
have
Daenerys
Targaryen
assassinated
before
the
Dothraki
can
invade
Westeros
Littlefinger
later
introduces
Eddard
to
Mhaegen
a
prostitute
and
mother
of
yet
another
of
King
Roberts
bastard
children
Outside
the
brothel
Eddard
gets
into
a
fight
with
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
Littlefinger
flees
promising
to
return
with
the
City
Watch
Littlefinger
is
stunned
when
Eddard
orders
that
Gregor
Clegane
be
arrested
and
executed
for
his
raids
on
the
Riverlands
and
when
he
also
orders
Tywin
Lannister
to
present
himself
at
court
to
answer
for
his
bannermans
crimes
Littlefinger
reminds
Eddard
that
Tywin
is
the
richest
man
in
Westeros
and
that
it
is
gold
that
wins
wars
not
armies
Eddard
disagrees
asking
why
then
Tywin
is
not
the
king
Littlefinger
tutors
a
new
recruit
to
his
brothels
Ros
and
discusses
his
ambitions
with
her
Later
Eddard
tells
him
the
truth
of
Joffreys
parentage
and
his
plan
to
install
Stannis
on
the
throne
when
Robert
dies
Baelish
turns
on
Eddard
Stark
Littlefinger
suggests
instead
that
they
let
Joffrey
rule
but
act
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
If
he
does
not
mature
into
the
king
they
want
they
can
expose
his
dirty
secret
and
install
Lord
Renly
instead
Eddard
rejects
the
plan
as
treason
and
instead
asks
Littlefinger
to
win
over
the
City
Watch
to
their
cause
Littlefinger
agrees
but
later
the
City
Watch
turns
on
Eddards
men
and
kills
them
while
Littlefinger
holds
a
dagger
to
Eddards
throat
pointing
out
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me

Baelish
asks
the
Queen
to

to
prove
her
loyalty
as
he
attends
the
girls

Queen
and
the

stands
with

details
of
Joffreys
reign
are
read
out
and
Barristan
Selmys
position
is
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
Jaime
Lannister
a
snide
remark
from
Baelish
at
Selmys
expense
causes
the
seasoned
knight
to
draw
his
sword
and
toss
it
at
the
kings
feet
He
glances
suspiciously
at
Varys
as
Sansa
seeks
pardon
for
her
fathers
actions
Baelish
watches
on
as
Eddard
Stark
confesses
at
his
trial
and
is
executed

discusses
kingship
with

and
they
engage
in
banter
revolving
around
the
Master
of
Whisperers

responds
by
referencing

reprimand
when

that

out

leaves
on
an
upcoming
mission
With
his

and
prepare
to

However
knowing
full
well
that

her
on

with
him

to
collect

Littlefinger
orders
one
of
his
homosexual
prostitutes
Olyvar
to
act
as

squire
and
seduce
him
all
the

to
admit
to

Olyvar
relays
this
piece
of
information
back
to

The
Vale
of

Baelish
deduces
that
it
must
have
been

who
betrayed
him
so
he
gives
her
to
King
Joffrey
who
tortures
and
kills
her
with
his
crossbow
In
the
throne
room
Littlefinger
confronts
Varys
about
his
foiled
plot
Varys
responds
by
telling
him
that
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
good
of
the
realm
to
prevent
it
spiralling
into
chaos
but
Littlefinger
counters
him
by
asserting
that
he
views
chaos
as
the
perfect
scenario
to
climb
further
up
the
social
ladder
His
ship
then
departs
for

she
killed

Still
sailing
Lord
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
at
her
cabin
and
tells
her
that
they
are
on
their
way
to
the
Vale
where
she
will
be
safe
Sansa
accuses
him
of
killing
Joffrey
he
tries
to
deny
it
at
first
but
Sansa
knows
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
because
getting
her
out
of
Kings
Landing
was
part
of
the
plan
He
admits
it
telling
her
about
the
poison
in
the
necklace
and
states
that
Joffrey
couldnt
be
trusted
and
had
to
be
removed
Because
Baelish
has
been
away
for
a
while
he
would
never
be
suspected
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
confuse
the
Lannisterswhich
his
new
friend
Lady
Olenna
wanted
very
badly
Littlefinger
and
Sansa
now
pretending
to
be
his

Gate
and
make
their
ascent
to
the
Eyrie
where
they
meet

Arryn
and
her
son
Lord
Robin
After
Sansa
is
acquainted
with
the
two
of
them
and
is
told
that
no
one
can
know
about
her
presence
Robin
takes
her
to
her
chambers
Baelish
is
left
alone
with
Lysa
who
kisses
him
and
tells
him
she
wants
to
marry
him
immediately
He
is
reluctant
at
first
and
wants
to
inform
the
Lords
of
the
Vale
about
the
ceremony
but
Lysa
says
that
they
already
had
their
wedding
night
long
ago
She
then
asks
him
what
wife
would
do
for
him
the
things
she
had
done
for
him
including
poisoning
her
husbands
wine
thus
killing
him
and
then
writing
a
letter
to
her
sister
Catelyn
claiming
it
had
been
the
Lannisters
who
did
it
all
of
this
at
Littlefingers
behest
He
starts
to
kiss
her
before
anyone
can
overhear
her
Lysa
then
brings
a
septon
into
the
hall
to
wed
them
immediately
and
says
that
she
will
scream
loudly
as
her
husband
Lord
Baelish
is
making
love
to
her
that
night
She
keeps
her
promise
much
to
Sansas
annoyance
Littlefinger
kisses
Sansa
The
next
day
after
Sansa
slaps
Robin
for
ruining
the
snowcastle
of
Winterfell
she
made
in
the
Eyries
courtyard
Littlefinger
approaches
her
and
calms
her
down
stating
that
Robin
shouldve
been
disciplined
by
his
mother
long
ago
and
that
he
will
deal
with
Lysa
When
Sansa
states
she
will
never
see
Winterfell
again
he
counters
that
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
never
and
that
she
must
demolish
her
old
home
if
she
wants
to
build
one
anew
Sansa
insists
to
know
why
he
killed
Joffrey
He
answers
that
he
did
it
out
of
love
for
Sansas
mother
He
adds
that
in
a
different
world
she
might
have
been
his
child
He
dismisses
the
notion
and
states
shes
more
beautiful
that
Catelyn
ever
was
He
kisses
Sansa
afterward
Later
Petyr
prevents
Lysa
from
throwing
Sansa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
after
she
saw
the
kiss
After
Lysa
is
more
subdued
Petyr
tells
her
he
has
always
loved
only
one
woman
your
sister
He
then
pushes
Lysa
out
of
the
Moon
Door
Following
Lysas
death
Petyr
Baelish
is
questioned
by
Lord
Yohn
Royce
Lady
Anya
Waynwood
and
Ser
Vance
Corbray
about
Lysas
death
which
he
claims
was
suicide
The
lords
dont
believe
him
given
Lysas
devotion
to
her
son
They
rebuff
Littlefingers
explanations
in
favor
of
speaking
with
the
only
other
witness
his
niece
Alayne
Baelish
is
noticeably
concerned
after
they
reveal
that
they
will
not
allow
him
to
speak
to
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony
in
order
to
hear
the
unadulterated
truth
However
after
confirming
that
Baelish
can
stay
for
her
testimony
Alayne
reveals
her
true
identity
the
tale
of
her
captivity
and
flight
from
Kings
Landing
She
then
speaks
of
Lysas
mental
instability
jealousy
and
death
changing
only
a
few
details
saying
Littlefinger
only
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
that
Lysa
did
throw
herself
from
the
Moon
Door
Sansa
breaks
down
in
tears
and
the
lords
are
convinced
but
while
none
of
them
are
looking
she
gives
Littlefinger
a
stony
almost
triumphant
gaze
Baelish
is
interrogated
following
Lysas
death
Following
the
questioning
Petyr
admonishes
the
lords
for
hiding
away
in
the
Vale
during
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
questioning
their
loyalty
because
they
refused
Catelyn
Starks
plea
for
assistance
in
the
conflict
against
the
Lannisters
When
asked
who
he
thinks
they
should
back
he
responds
that
they
should
back
Robin
Arryn
Lord
of
the
Vale
When
the
lords
scoff
at
his
suggestion
claiming
that
Robin
is
just
a
sickly
boy
Petyr
responds
by
declaring
that
even
sickly
little
boys
can
become
powerful
men
and
that
it
is
time
for
young
Robin
to
leave
the
nest
The
boy
he
claims
needs
to
learn
to
ride
a
horse
to
swing
a
sword
and
to
become
the
lord
the
Vale
needs
He
offers
to
take
Lord
Robin
on
a
tour
of
the
Vale
in
order
for
him
to
become
acquainted
with
his
domains
a
request
that
the
lords
agree
to
Baelish
prepares
Robin
to
leave
the
Eyrie
Later
Baelish
visits
Sansa
and
asks
why
she
lied
on
his
behalf
Without
looking
up
from
the
dress
she
is
mending
Sansa
explains
that
she
has
no
idea
what
Royce
Corbray
and
Waynwood
would
want
from
her
if
he
were
eliminated
but
that
she
does
know
what
it
is
he
wants
Littlefinger
seems
impressed
that
she
made
such
a
calculating
decision
but
attempts
to
cast
doubt
on
her
certainty
Sansa
doesnt
take
the
bait
Later
on
Baelish
and
Robin
stand
in
the
High
Hall
preparing
to
depart
for
their
tour
of
the
Vale
Robin
expresses
his
uncertainty
about
leaving
the
Eyrie
echoing
his
mothers
words
that
the
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place
where
he
could
die
Petyr
calms
his
fears
by
stating
that
people
die
from
everyday
causes
and
that
instead
of
worrying
about
his
inevitable
death
to
spend
time
focusing
on
his
life
which
lays
before
him
At
that
moment
a
ravenhaired
Sansa
appears
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
a
feathered
black
dress
with
a
plunging
neckline
Petyr
stares
at
her
intently
clearly
intrigued
and
pleased
by
her
recent
transformation
and
she
returns
his
smile
knowingly
Season
Littlefinger
watches
Lord
Robin
practice
his
swordsmanship
along
with
Sansa
and
Yohn
Royce
Littlefinger
attends
a
sword
jousting
session
for
Lord
Robin
at
Runestone
along
with
Alayne
and
Yohn
Royce
Royce
remarks
on
Robins
weak
skills
at
swordsmanship
but
Petyr
insists
his
name
is
all
that
matters
not
his
skill
A
maester
delivers
him
a
raven
message
which
he
reads
discreetly
Littlefinger
leaves
Robin
in
the
care
of
Lord
Royce
for
further
training
On
the
carriage
ride
he
is
questioned
by
Sansa
as
to
why
they
are
heading
west
when
Lord
Royce
was
told
they
would
be
traveling
to
the
Fingers
unsure
of
his
source
of
distrust
Petyr
promises
her
that
they
are
going
somewhere
far
away
where
Sansa
will
be
safe
from
Queen
Cersei
While
at
an
inn
Petyr
and
Sansa
are
confronted
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
who
previously
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark
to
keep
the
Stark
girls
safe
Petyr
reminds
Brienne
that
she
swore
an
oath
to
Renly
Baratheon
and
Catelyn
Stark
both
of
whom
are
now
dead
in
order
to
stop
Sansa
from
trusting
her
Petyr
attempts
to
persuade
Brienne
to
rest
with
them
but
Brienne
and
her
squire
Podrick
Payne
escape
and
discreetly
continue
to
follow
Petyr
and
his
party
Littlefingers
motives
are
questioned
by
Roose
Bolton
However
when
the
party
arrives
at
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
realizes
that
Petyr
intends
to
marry
her
to
Ramsay
Bolton
the
son
of
Lord
Roose
Bolton
who
betrayed
and
murdered
her
brother
and
mother
Despite
Sansas
reluctance
to
marry
into
another
family
that
harmed
hers
Petyr
persuades
her
to
go
along
with
the
plan
citing
it
as
a
chance
to
avenge
her
family
They
subsequently
ride
through
Moat
Cailin
and
arrive
at
Winterfell
Later
Petyr
speaks
with
Ramsay
and
subtly
warns
him
not
to
inflict
any
harm
on
Sansa
He
also
speaks
with
Roose
regarding
the
validity
of
Sansas
marriage
to
Tyrion
Lannister
Petyr
insists
that
since
Tyrion
never
slept
with
Sansa
their
marriage
is
invalid
Roose
declares
that
he
is
not
only
interested
in
Sansas
name
not
her
virtue
after
Baelish
suggests
he
have
Sansa
inspected
and
voices
his
doubts
as
to
whose
side
Petyr
is
truly
on
having
essentially
betrayed
the
Lannisters
by
taking
Sansa
away
from
them
and
returning
her
to
the
North
to
marry
into
a
family
that
the
Lannisters
are
no
longer
backing
though
Petyr
counters
by
citing
Rooses
betrayal
of
the
Starks
and
Tullys
Roose
then
presents
a
letter
for
Petyr
from
Cersei
which
arrived
from
the
Eyrie
and
demands
to
read
Petyrs
reply
before
it
is
sent
off
Later
on
Petyr
finds
Sansa
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell
paying
her
respects
to
her
deceased
family
members
Petyr
recalls
about
how
Rhaegar
Targaryen
kidnapped
Sansas
aunt
Lyanna
which
started
Robert
Baratheons
rebellion
against
the
Targaryen
family
Petyr
then
tells
Sansa
that
he
has
to
return
to
Kings
Landing
on
Cerseis
request
Sansa
expresses
unease
about
being
left
alone
in
Winterfell
but
Petyr
tells
her
not
to
worry
since
Stannis
Baratheon
is
garrisoned
at
Castle
Black
and
will
most
likely
make
another
try
for
the
Iron
Throne
which
will
require
him
to
retake
Winterfell
destroy
the
Boltons
and
win
the
Northern
Lords
to
his
side
and
out
of
respect
for
Ned
Starks
support
of
his
claim
Stannis
will
rescue
Sansa
and
name
her
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
and
if
Stannis
is
killed
or
does
not
even
come
then
Petyr
suggests
Sansa
can
destroy
the
Boltons
from
within
He
kisses
her
on
the
lips
again
and
departs
Baelish
returns
to
Kings
Landing
to
find
the
city
under
the
rule
of
the
newlyreestablished
Faith
Militant
Lancel
Lannister
a
member
of
the
religious
cult
known
as
the
Sparrows
warns
him
that
his
days
as
a
brothel
owner
in
the
capital
are
over
He
goes
to
meet
Cersei
and
he
informs
her
of
the
Boltons
plans
to
marry
Sansa
to
Ramsay
Angered
at
the
Boltons
betrayal
Cersei
agrees
with
Baelishs
plans
to
lead
an
army
of
Vale
knights
to
Winterfell
to
reclaim
the
North
for
the
Lannisters
as
the
warriors
from
the
Eyrie
are
trained
to
fight
in
winter
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
at
this
point
but
only
once
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
Baratheon
have
battled
over
the
North
and
weakened
both
armies
In
exchange
Baelish
asks
to
be
appointed
as
the
new
Warden
of
the
North
once
Winterfell
is
taken
and
both
the
Boltons
and
Stannis
are
defeated
Cersei
agrees
and
tells
him
to
return
that
night
to
have
the
King
sign
a
royal
decree
promoting
him
Baelish
reveals
crucial
information
to
Olenna
Baelish
later
stands
in
his
ruined
brothel
with
a
look
of
regret
He
is
approached
by
Olenna
Tyrell
having
sent
her
a
letter
to
speak
with
him
As
they
speak
Olenna
mentions
how
her
grandchildren
Margaery
and
Loras
have
been
arrested
due
to
Cerseis
machinations
and
demands
his
help
by
threatening
that
if
anything
happens
to
her
or
if
House
Tyrell
goes
down
she
will
reveal
his
involvement
in
Joffreys
murder
which
will
certainly
lead
to
his
execution
Baelish
reveals
that
Cersei
summoned
him
to
Kings
Landing
for
a
piece
of
information
he
had
his
prostitute
Olyvar
and
he
tells
Olenna
that
he
will
give
her
the
same
thing
he
gave
Cersei
a
handsome
young
man
implied
in
this
instance
to
be
Lancel
Offscreen
Olenna
subsequently
forces
Lancel
to
reveal
the
adulterous
affair
he
had
with
Cersei
to
the
High
Sparrow
who
has
her
arrested
Season
Baelish
convinces
Robin
Arryn
to
join
the
fray
Baelish
returns
to
Runestone
and
greets
Robin
Arryn
and
Yohn
Royce
Yohn
quickly
voices
his
suspicion
of
Baelishs
involvement
in
Sansas
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
since
Baelish
had
told
Yohn
that
Sansa
was
going
to
the
Fingers
with
him
With
the
intention
of
manipulating
Robin
Baelish
responds
by
falsely
claiming
the
Boltons
ambushed
Sansa
and
Baelish
on
the
way
to
the
Fingers
and
insinuates
that
Yohn
leaked
the
information
to
the
Boltons
Robins
first
thought
is
to
have
Yohn
thrown
through
the
Moon
Door
for
this
false
treason
but
asks
for
Baelishs
advice
on
what
to
do
with
Yohn
Baelish
responds
that
if
Yohn
can
ensure
his
loyalty
to
Robin
Arryn
which
Yohn
quickly
gives
that
Yohn
should
be
given
a
final
chance
Baelish
then
immediately
followsup
and
tells
Robin
that
he
has
learned
that
Sansa
has
fled
Winterfell
and
will
likely
head
to
Castle
Black
for
protection
though
the
Boltons
will
pursue
her
Robin
responds
that
since
Sansa
is
his
cousin
that
he
should
help
her
Baelish
takes
his
cue
and
orders
Yohn
to
gather
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
rescue
Sansa
from
the
Boltons
This
brings
an
end
to
the
neutrality
of
House
Arryn
which
until
then
had
steered
clear
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Later
Baelish
sends
a
letter
to
Sansa
at
Castle
Black
asking
to
meet
in
Moles
Town
Sansa
travels
to
Moles
Town
with
Brienne
and
confronts
Baelish
about
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
coldly
asking
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
Ramsays
sadistic
side
all
along
or
if
he
was
unaware
and
therefore
just
stupid
Baelish
responds
that
he
made
a
mistake
trusting
a
stranger
but
has
rallied
the
knights
of
the
Vale
to
protect
her
and
that
the
army
is
encamped
at
Moat
Cailin
Sansa
refuses
his
help
saying
that
Baelish
cannot
protect
her
that
he
cannot
even
protect
himself
if
she
orders
Brienne
to
strike
him
down
and
telling
him
that
she
already
has
Jon
Snows
help
and
they
will
rally
other
Northern
houses
to
their
cause
She
finishes
by
warning
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
Baelish
as
he
prepares
to
leave
tells
Sansa
of
her
greatuncle
Brynden
Tullys
success
in
recapturing
Riverrun
and
suggests
reaching
out
to
him
for
support
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Knights
of
the
Vale
When
failing
to
rally
enough
houses
to
their
side
Sansa
secretly
writes
Baelish
to
take
him
up
on
the
offer
she
previously
rejected
Baelish
arrives
with
the
Vale
Knights
of
House
Arryn
just
when
the
Stark
force
is
about
to
be
massacred
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
easily
wipe
out
what
remains
of
the
Bolton
army
Baelish
is
present
when
Wun
Wun
smashes
down
the
door
to
Winterfell
and
witnesses
Jon
defeat
Ramsay
in
combat
House
Stark
is
subsequently
restored
as
Lords
of
Winterfell
and
Ramsay
is
executed
In
the
battles
aftermath
Baelish
approaches
Sansa
in
the
Godswood
and
finally
admits
that
his
goal
is
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
Sansa
as
his
queen
Despite
Baelish
having
declared
for
House
Stark
Sansa
refuses
to
trust
him
due
to
Baelishs
tendency
to
betray
those
he
declares
for
for
his
own
wellbeing
Baelish
however
questions
her
trust
in
Jon
naming
him
as
a
motherless
bastard
and
insinuating
that
Sansa
should
rule
the
North
and
not
him
He
is
later
present
at
the
meeting
where
Jon
is
proclaimed
the
new
King
in
the
North
by
the
Northern
Lords
along
with
the
Vale
Lords
and
the
Free
Folk
He
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
cheer
and
instead
stares
at
Sansa
as
if
to
remind
her
that
she
has
apparently
been
usurped
of
her
right
to
the
North
Season
Petyr
questions
Sansas
happiness
Petyr
watches
disapprovingly
as
Jon
hands
the
castles
of
Last
Hearth
and
Karhold
back
over
to
Ned
Umber
and
Alys
Karstark
despite
their
parents
role
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
He
later
confronts
Sansa
to
see
if
she
is
truly
safe
and
happy
She
remarks
on
her
safety
in
Winterfell
but
he
continues
to
question
her
in
regards
to
her
happiness
Once
Brienne
arrives
Sansa
dismisses
Petyr
just
as
he
is
about
to
speak
Petyr
speaks
with
Jon
Petyr
watches
as
Jon
discusses
accepting
the
deal
to
meet
withDaenerys
Targaryen
to
the
other
lords
citing
the
need
for
Dragonglass
to
forge
weapons
to
kill
White
Walkers
after
receiving
a
raven
from
Samwell
Tarly
and
smirks
as
Jon
leaves
Sansa
in
charge
while
he
is
gone
In
Winterfells
crypt
Petyr
assures
Jon
he
only
wants
to
help
him
but
also
admits
his
love
for
Sansa
Disgusted
Jon
shoves
Petyr
against
the
wall
warning
him
to
stay
away
from
Sansa
before
storming
out
Petyr
later
meets
with
the
recently
returned
Bran
Stark
and
gives
him
the
Valyrian
steel
dagger
that
was
used
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
life
from
the
catspaw
Unimpressed
and
uninterested
Bran
simply
asks
if
he
knows
who
had
the
dagger
before
the
assassin
to
which
he
responds
that
same
question
started
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Petyr
then
asks
Bran
how
he
survived
beyond
the
Wall
only
to
return
to
such
chaos
to
which
Bran
replies
Chaos
is
a
ladder
the
very
thing
Petyr
said
to
Varys
during
his
rise
in
power
after
allowing
Joffrey
Baratheon
to
kill
Ros
Slightly
unnerved
Petyr
then
exits
upon
the
entrance
of
Meera
Reed
addressing
Bran
as
Lord
Stark
However
Bran
corrects
him
saying
that
his
profession
as
the
threeeyed
raven
doesnt
allow
this
Littlefinger
cunningly
watches
Aryas
return
Petyr
later
watches
from
the
battlements
as
Arya
Stark
returns
to
Winterfell
and
as
she
begins
to
spar
with
Brienne
However
after
the
practice
they
both
look
up
at
him
with
a
disapproving
and
untrustworthy
look
Yet
again
hatching
another
cunning
plan
he
bows
from
the
high
walls
and
walks
away
from
the
gaze
of
Arya
After
trying
and
failing
to
manipulate
the
other
Stark
children
Petyr
formulates
a
plan
to
separate
the
Stark
sisters
starting
with
Arya
Arya
herself
becomes
increasingly
suspicious
of
Petyr
and
begins
shadowing
him
in
order
to
figure
out
his
plan
He
engages
in
conversation
with
a
common
girl
before
giving
her
money
for
her
information
Arya
then
follows
him
around
Winterfell
watching
him
from
the
battlements
as
he
eerily
converses
with
Yohn
Royce
and
Robett
Glover
Petyr
then
receives
Maester
Luwins
copy
of
Sansas
letter
to
Robb
asking
him
to
surrender
to
Joffrey
from
Wolkan
who
assures
him
that
there
is
no
other
copy
in
Winterfell
Arya
then
retrieves
the
letter
after
investigating
his
chambers
Littlefinger
begs
for
his
life
before
he
is
executed
However
Petyr
watches
from
the
shadows
as
Arya
exits
showing
that
he
knew
all
along
of
her
spying
on
him
and
was
counting
on
her
to
find
the
letter
Petyr
smiles
hoping
this
will
turn
the
hottempered
Arya
against
her
sister
After
Arya
confronts
Sansa
over
the
letter
Sansa
becomes
worried
that
Arya
could
turn
the
Northerners
against
her
or
even
worse
harm
her
in
some
way
and
voices
her
concerns
to
Petyr
Petyr
reminds
her
that
Brienne
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
that
she
would
watch
over
both
Stark
sisters
and
should
protect
her
from
Arya
if
the
latter
was
to
try
and
murder
Sansa
When
Arya
is
seemingly
brought
to
face
trial
for
murder
and
treason
Sansa
catches
Petyr
off
guard
when
she
asks
how
he
wishes
to
answer
for
his
crimes
She
then
reveals
to
all
the
Northern
and
Vale
lords
gathered
there
including
Yohn
Royce
whom
she
previously
lied
to
that
Petyr
did
in
fact
kill
her
aunt
Lysa
He
also
planned
the
assassination
of
Jon
Arryn
and
conspired
with
the
Lannisters
to
imprison
Ned
so
they
could
frame
him
for
treason
When
Baelish
tries
to
deny
the
charges
Bran
reminds
Petyr
that
he
held
a
knife
to
Neds
throat
and
repeats
what
he
said
then
I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me
With
all
the
facts
laid
bare
and
no
one
to
turn
to
for
aid
Petyr
falls
to
his
knees
and
begs
for
his
life
claiming
that
he
had
loved
Catelyn
since
he
was
a
boy
but
Sansa
replies
he
still
betrayed
her
Petyr
insists
he
loves
Sansa
but
she
replies
he
betrayed
her
too
Arya
slits
his
throat
with
the
same
dagger
that
was
given
to
the
Catspaw
assassin
to
kill
Bran
Gasping
for
air
Petyr
dies
and
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
When
they
later
discuss
the
execution
Sansa
tells
Arya
in
his
own
horrible
way
I
believe
he
loved
me
Personality
Littlefinger
was
born
with
no
lands
no
wealth
no
armies
He
has
acquired
the
first
two
How
long
before
he
has
the
army
Perhaps
youll
laugh
but
I
know
him
better
than
most
and
this
is
the
truth
Littlefinger
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
Westeros
Varys
regarding
Littlefinger
to
Olenna
Tyrellsrc
Baelish
is
a
cunning
Machiavellian
unpredictable
and
ruthless
manipulator
of
court
politics
He
is
at
times
capable
of
putting
on
a
seemingly
friendly
face
with
a
friendly
smile
but
his
eyes
dont
smile
when
his
mouth
does
The
exact
inner
motivations
that
drive
Baelish
are
unclear
as
are
his
ultimate
goals
but
he
has
no
real
loyalty
or
genuine
affection
for
anyone
Behind
his
smiles
and
forced
mild
manners
Littlefinger
is
shrewd
and
calculating
willing
to
casually
dispose
of
people
who
trusted
him
like
a
man
replacing
a
coat
he
no
longer
needs
He
is
an
extremely
intelligent
man
not
only
a
genius
at
financial
matters
but
at
cynically
controlling
those
around
him
As
Varys
observed
he
is
a
grasper
from
a
minor
House
with
a
very
great
skill
at
befriending
and
ultimately
maneuvering
powerful
people
Littlefinger
started
out
as
an
impoverished
noble
from
an
insignificant
minor
House
in
the
little
Finger
peninsula
of
the
Vale
but
felt
constantly
looked
down
upon
for
his
relatively
lowly
status
by
much
higher
noblemen
His
treatment
by
the
Tullys
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
neardeath
at
the
hands
of
Brandon
Stark
embittered
him
against
both
the
Tullys
and
the
Starks
He
was
also
never
strongly
attached
to
the
other
Vale
lords
who
looked
down
on
him
most
of
his
life
Petyr
loved
Catelyn
but
she
saw
him
only
like
a
brother
and
her
father
wanted
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
In
truth
underneath
Littlefingers
peoplemask
he
is
a
cold
sociopath
who
hungers
for
power
over
others
basically
for
its
own
sake
Curiously
even
seemingly
plausible
goals
such
as
revenge
against
the
Starks
and
Tullys
which
at
times
is
what
he
tells
himself
he
is
doing
are
really
only
excuses
and
rationalizations
for
his
utter
ambition
to
control
everything
around
him
he
has
stated
more
than
once
that
he
wants
everything
Even
Littlefingers
alleged
feelings
for
Catelyn
Stark
truly
seem
to
have
just
been
a
rationalization
for
his
greed
for
power
Though
surely
Littlefinger
himself
is
convinced
that
he
truly
loved
her
in
reality
his
attraction
was
onesided
and
he
was
obsessively
stalking
a
girl
who
never
returned
his
affections
beyond
a
platonic
level
Hypocritically
Littlefinger
became
angered
that
the
Tullys
rejected
him
probably
for
his
low
social
status
when
Catelyns
younger
sister
Lysa
Tully
was
utterly
obsessed
with
him
Petyr
ironically
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
Lysa
and
used
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
to
get
to
Catelyn
Later
after
Catelyn
died
Littlefinger
transferred
his
obsession
to
Sansa
Even
though
as
he
himself
noted
Sansa
is
young
enough
to
be
his
own
daughter
she
reminds
him
so
much
of
the
young
Catelyn
at
her
age
that
he
forgets
himself
even
allowing
himself
to
try
to
kiss
her
showing
that
he
didnt
really
love
Catelyn
as
a
person
so
much
as
a
concept
given
that
he
feels
she
is
interchangeable
with
her
daughter
In
brief
moments
when
Littlefinger
has
opened
up
to
Sansa
Stark
it
is
disturbingly
revealed
that
despite
his
keen
skill
at
assessing
the
emotions
and
goals
of
others
and
using
it
to
manipulate
them
he
has
a
highly
warped
skewed
view
of
the
world
In
Littlefingers
mind
he
narrates
himself
as
the
hero
of
his
own
storybook
as
it
were
as
he
says
the
weak
boy
from
a
minor
family
who
hoped
that
in
a
better
world
love
could
overcome
strength
and
duty
He
genuinely
feels
or
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
the
victim
in
all
of
this
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
orchestrated
the
entire
War
of
the
Five
Kings
a
war
in
which
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
and
civilians
have
died
Littlefinger
nonetheless
believes
he
is
the
victim
of
the
uncaring
forces
of
a
stratified
aristocracy
that
prevented
him
from
marrying
Catelyn
when
in
reality
Catelyn
herself
was
simply
never
romantically
interested
in
him
regardless
of
his
social
status
Petyrs
surprising
lack
of
insight
when
it
comes
to
his
romantic
obsessions
was
revealed
when
he
encountered
Catelyn
again
in
Renly
Baratheons
army
camp
after
her
husbands
execution
a
betrayal
which
Catelyn
by
now
would
surely
have
known
he
was
at
least
partially
complicit
in
Instead
Petyr
started
babbling
nonsensically
to
Catelyn
that
fate
had
granted
them
the
opportunity
to
finally
be
together
now
that
Eddard
was
dead
even
though
he
previously
saw
that
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
any
sane
man
would
realize
that
she
would
be
both
deeply
in
mourning
for
her
husband
and
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
his
death
Littlefingers
stalkercrush
extended
to
the
point
that
even
after
years
of
bitterly
hating
the
Tullys
and
Starks
and
even
hating
Catelyn
at
times
for
rejecting
him
at
other
times
he
would
persist
to
indulge
in
fantasies
that
one
day
she
would
come
running
into
his
arms
Some
men
such
as
Varys
engage
in
court
intrigue
and
engage
in
murder
because
they
feel
they
are
doing
what
they
must
to
ensure
safety
and
order
for
the
realm
as
a
whole
while
other
men
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
engage
in
court
intrigue
because
they
want
to
secure
more
power
for
themselves
and
for
their
family
legacy
Baelish
meanwhile
does
these
things
just
because
he
can
he
enjoys
exerting
power
over
other
people
Sometimes
this
can
take
the
form
of
outwitting
or
outmaneuvering
major
court
players
such
as
Varys
or
Cersei
even
Tyrion
Lannister
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
the
game
Yet
Littlefinger
also
enjoys
crushing
the
powerless
when
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
Baelishs
acquisition
of
multiple
brothels
sums
up
a
major
aspect
of
his
personality
he
is
willing
to
use
other
people
often
vulnerable
and
weak
people
ie
prostitutes
purely
for
his
own
gain
cynically
selling
his
whores
sexual
services
for
gold
while
at
the
same
time
using
the
weaknesses
of
his
enemies
as
leverage
ie
blackmailing
them
about
their
visits
to
his
brothels
Sometimes
Baelish
doesnt
even
use
people
for
any
actual
purpose
but
simply
because
he
enjoys
destroying
them
like
a
man
swatting
a
fly
Despite
his
ingenious
planning
and
manipulation
Baelish
is
not
incapable
of
making
mistakes
nor
is
he
above
overplaying
his
hand
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
position
political
or
otherwise
which
is
a
direct
contrast
to
Littlefingers
usual
meek
and
cautious
nature
proving
himself
not
above
arrogance
The
first
mistake
was
when
he
subtly
made
a
jab
at
Cersei
about
her
unnatural
relationship
with
her
brother
Jaime
that
knowledge
is
power
which
resulted
in
Cersei
nearly
having
him
killed
before
deciding
to
remind
him
of
his
place
Another
fatal
flaw
Baelish
has
is
underestimating
people
He
remarked
to
Varys
that
Tyrion
is
an
unworthy
ally
seemingly
underestimated
Ramsay
Boltons
vile
nature
wrongly
believed
that
the
North
would
not
rally
behind
a
motherless
bastard
like
Jon
Snow
and
was
initially
skeptical
of
Bran
Starks
omniscience
as
the
new
threeeyed
raven

which
led

his
death

Chaos

Many

Behind
the
scenes
Littlefinger
narrates
the
Histories
Lore
videos
on
The
Vale
and
Roberts
Rebellion
on
the
Season
Bluray
House
Baelish
on
the
Season
Bluray
and
Knights
of
the
Vale
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Petyr
Baelishs
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully
during
the
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings
where
they
fought
together
Nothing
is
known
about
Petyrs
mother
except
that
her
name
was
Alayne
On
the
basis
of
the
above
acquaintance
Petyr
was
sent
to
foster
at
Riverrun
where
he
met
Hosters
own
daughters
Catelyn
and
Lysa
Lysa
developed
a
crush
on
Petyr
but
Petyr
preferred
the
older
more
unobtainable
Catelyn
When
Catelyn
was
betrothed
to
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell
Petyr
challenged
Brandon
to
a
duel
of
honor
for
Catelyns
hand
but
was
soundly
defeated
After
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
injures
Lord
Hoster
had
Petyr
returned
home
He
was
later
appointed
as
a
customs
official
in
Gulltown
the
main
city
of
the
Vale
and
his
extreme
success
in
raising
funds
led
Lord
Jon
Arryn
the
Hand
of
the
King
to
appoint
him
to
the
small
council
as
Master
of
Coin
a
task
at
which
Petyr
has
excelled
Littlefinger
is
a
nickname
given
to
Petyr
by
Edmure
Tully
during
their
time
at
Riverrun
together
It
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
Petyr
Baelishs
holdings
are
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers
the
numerous
headlands
and
peninsulas
protruding
into
the
Narrow
Sea
on
the
Vales
east
coast
Unlike
in
the
TV
series
Tyrion
learns
from
Catelyn
that
it
was
Littlefinger
who
told
her
the
dagger
found
on
the
Catspaw
assassin
sent
to
kill
Bran
Stark
belonged
to
Tyrion
Littlefinger
explained
that
it
had
previously
belonged
to
him
until
he
lost
it
in
a
wager
with
Tyrion
when
Jaime
Lannister
was
unhorsed
by
Loras
Tyrell
Tyrion
states
that
this
cannot
be
true
because
he
never
bets
against
Jaime
Catelyn
asks
why
Petyr
would
lie
to
her
to
which
Tyrion
retorts
why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods
Because
it
is
in
his
nature
Catelyn
realizes
too
late
that
Littlefinger
lied
to
her
when
Jaime
Lannister
independently
verifies
Tyrions
account
and
had
no
reason
to
lie
having
just
confessed
to
pushing
Bran
from
the
window
Catelyn
does
not
have
a
chance
to
confront
Littlefinger
about
his
lie
Tyrion
does
but
for
an
unknown
reason
he
does
not
settle
his
score
with
Littlefinger
even
though
he
suffered
a
lot
and
almost
got
killed
three
times
due
to
that
lie
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
does
not
go
to
Harrenhal
neither
before
nor
after
he
becomes
its
lord
He
explains
to
Sansa
it
is
because
of
the
curse
which
caused
the
destruction
of
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
and
the
death
of
every
individual
who
served
as
its
castellan
Lady
Whent
Tywin
Amory
Lorch
Vargo
Hoat
the
Mountain
and
Polliver
It
is
implied
in
the
novels
that
Littlefinger
lusts
after
Sansa
perhaps
because
she
looks
so
much
like
her
mother
who
is
lost
to
him
forever
In
the
fourth
novel
he
kisses
Sansa
passionately
several
times
and
once
touches
her
breasts
in
the
fifth
novel
Cersei
recalls
that
he
offered
to
wed
Sansa
but
was
denied
because
he
was
much
too
lowborn
Nevertheless
Littlefinger
does
not
let
his
personal
desires
interfere
with
his
plans
Unlike
in
the
show
Littlefinger
and
Lysa
are
married
at
the
Fingers
because
Lysainsists
that
they
do
that
without
delayLittlefingerdoes
not
like
the
idea
and
tries
to
persuade
Lysa
to
hold
the
wedding
in
public
at
the
Eyrie
and
in
presence
of
Lysas
whole
court
in
order
to
make
the
Vale
lords
acknowledge
his
new
position
but
Lysa
is
too
stubborn
It
is
unknown
whether
Littlefinger
has
planned
in
advance
to
dispose
of
Lysa
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
do
that
or
it
was
a
spontaneous
decision
Either
way
the
timing
of
the
murder
not
the
murder
itself
has
posed
him
a
problem
he
has
not
been
married
to
Lysa
long
enough
to
establish
his
position
as
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
in
the
eyes
of
the
local
lords
Soon
afterward
Lord
Nestor
Royce
comes
to
inquire
about
Lysas
death
and
is
satisfied
byLittlefingers
smooth
lies
that
it
was
Marillion
At
that
occasion
Sansa
shivers
with
fear
especiallywhen
Littlefinger
says
brazenly
it
was
I
who
killed
her
as
if
talking
metaphorically
but
Littlefinger
gets
away
with
the
murder
Lord
Yohn
Royce
and
other
lords
of
the
Vale
known
as
Lords
Declarant
who
scornfully
consider
Littlefinger
an
outsider
upstart
intend
to
ousthim
from
theValeand
assume
the
rearing
and
training
of
Robert
They
inform
Cersei
about
their
intentions
Littlefinger
can
request
military
assistance
from
Cersei
but
does
not
he
sends
her
a
letter
asking
for
some
old
tapestries
and
barely
mentions
the
lords
who
oppose
him
Cersei
thinks
it
over
and
answers
the
lords
of
the
Vale
that
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
may
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryns
minority
providing
that
no
harm
happens
to
Littlefinger
Yohn
Royce
and
five
of
the
most
powerful
lords
of
the
Vale
come
to
the
Eyrie
demanding
that
Littlefingerleave
the
Vale
and
give
them
custody
over
Robert
Littlefingermanipulates
them
into
giving
him
a
trial
period
of
one
year
on
his
wardship
over
Robert
Later
he
explains
to
Sansa
that
in
one
year
five
of
those
lords
either
will
die
or
be
bribed
by
him
Lord
Royce
is
the
only
serious
obstacle
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat
Littlefinger
does
not
leave
the
Vale
and
makes
no
contact
with
the
Boltons
Instead
he
spends
his
time
making
contacts
and
attempting
to
win
over
lords
of
the
Vale
the
neutral
ones
and
those
who
oppose
him
So
far
he
has
managed
to
draw
three
of
the
six
Lords
Declarant
to
his
side
Symond
Templeton
Benedar
Belmore
and
Anya
Waynwood
Littlefinger
explains
his
plan
to
Sansa
after
Robert
dies
his
health
is
so
poor
that
he
will
probably
die
within
a
few
years
she
will
wed
his
heir
Ser
Harold
Hardyng
Sansa
remindsLittlefinger
she
is
married
and
he
answersThe
dwarf
wed
Ned
Starks
daughter
not
mine
Be
that
as
it
may
This
is
only
a
betrothal
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansas
safely
widowed
At
the
wedding
Sansa
will
reveal
her
true
identity
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
back
her
birthright
and
that
wayshe
will
take
over
both
the
Vale
and
the
North
Littlefinger
is
still
alive
by
the
point
the
books
reached
Whereas
in
the
series
Littlefingers
goals
are
more
transparent
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
novels
As
Littlefinger
is
only
seen
through
the
POV
of
other
characters
Catelyn
Sansa
Tyrion
his
ultimate
objective
remains
a
mystery
Likewise
his
rivalry
with
Varys
was
developed
for
the
show
According
to

TV
series

for

Giants
are
a
nonhuman
race
considered
to
be
legendary
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
south
of
the
Wall
However
for
many
years
wildlings
have
claimed
that
they
actually
exist
in
the
furthest
north
Beyond
the
Wall
This
is
in
contrast
with
both
the
Children
of
the
Forest
and
the
White
Walkers
which
even
the
wildlings
claim
to
have
not
seen
in
thousands
of
years
