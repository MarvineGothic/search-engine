enjoyed
the

enough
I
was
willing

were
zipping
around
so
absurdly
fast
that
it
broke

so
I
didnt
find
it
dramatically
satsifying
I
honestly
didnt

to
warriors
who
perform
exemplary

must

women
and

Knighthood
originated
in
Andal
culture
and
was
introduced
to
Westeros
during
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
As
a
result
of
this
knighthood
is
intimately
tied
to
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
and
the
ideal
of
knighthood
is
to
be
not
only
an
honorable
warrior
but
a
devout
follower
of
the
Seven
And
with
any
knight
honorable
conduct
and
level
of
piety
varies
from
person
to
person
The
Faith
of
the
Seven
is
the
dominant
religion
in
all
but
two
of
the
kingdoms
the
North
whose
inhabitants
still
worship
the
Old
Gods
of
the
Forest
and
the
Iron
Islands
who
follow
a
local
deity
called
the
Drowned
God
The
institution
of
knighthood
is
therefore
not
heavily
practiced
in
these
two
regions
and
very
few
Northerners
or
Ironborn
ever
choose
to
become
knights
even
if
they
are
renowned
warriors
For
example
Eddard
Stark
himself
was
not
a
knight
because
he
proudly
continued
to
worship
the
Old
Gods
of
his
ancestors
yet
he
was
still
a
great
warrior
Sometimes
however
a
soldier
who
does
not
follow
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
may
nonetheless
be
rewarded
for
exemplary
service
with
the
title
of
knighthood
by
a
lord
who
does
worship
the
Seven
Examples
areSer
Rodrik
Cassel
and
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
both
of
the
North
Because
it
is
tied
to
the
Faith
of
the
Seven
knighthood
does
not
exist
in
other
cultures
outside
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
either
among
the
wildlingsbeyond
the
Wall
nor
across
the
Narrow
Sea
in
other
continents
such
as
Essos
though
of
course
a
knight
from
the
Seven
Kingdoms
may
travel
to
the
Free
Cities

Sandor
Cleganesrc
Gregor
Clegane
is
knighted
by
Prince
Rhaegar
Targaryen
Typically
young
men
must
undergo
many
years
of
extensive
and
expensive
training
to
become
a
knight
A
young
knightintraining
is
known
as
a
Squire
Pursuing
a
knighthood
is
one
of
the
few
ways
for
a
member
of
the
smallfolk
to
achieve
rank
and
standing
amongst
the
nobility
However
such
a
task
usually
involves
the
expenditure
of
significant
sums
of
money
on
armor
and
weaponry
which
puts
it
out
of
the
reach
of
most
commoners
The
rank
of
knighthood
is
not
hereditary
and
thus
a
knights
sons
must
go
through
the
whole
process
of
becoming
knights
themselves
Of
course
a
commoner
who
has
been
knighted
will
have
greater
opportunity
to
gain
the
wealth
needed
to
put
his
sons
through
training
as
knights
It
is
not
unheard
of
however
for
commoners
to
be
knighted
after
significantly
distinguishing
themselves
in
combat
This
skips
the
typically
large
costs
of
training
to
be
a
knight
though
it
happens
more
often
in
wartime
During
Roberts
Rebellion
Stannis
Baratheon
knighted
Davos
Seaworth
as
a
reward
for
saving
his
castle
garrison
at
the
Siege
of
Storms
End
albeit
this
was
a
rare
case
in
which
Davossbravery
was
not
in
combat
but
in
running
the
blockade
around
the
castle
to
bring
food
to
the
starving
garrison
Even
a
common
sellsword
that
has
fought
valiantly
in
combat
may
be
rewarded
by
being
dubbed
a
knight
though
this
occurs
infrequently
For
example
Ser
Bronn
of
the
Blackwater
was
knighted
after
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
for
the
vital
role
he
played
in
setting
the
wildfire
trap
which
destroyed
much
of
the
attacking
enemy
fleet
Types
of
knights
In
theory
all
knights
hold
an
equal
rank
but
in
practice
knights
who
own
their
own
lands
or
who
serve
major
lords
are
much
more
highly
respected
than
a
landless
commoner
who
happened
to
be
knighted
after
fighting
valiantly
in
a
battle
It
is
also
seen
as
more
prestigious
to
be
knighted
by
a
king
a
major
lord
a
Kingsguard
or
another
highly
respected
knight
Any
knight
can
theoretically
make
another
man
a
knight
if
he
is
willing
to
say
the
vows
though
respectable
knights
would
not
hand
out
the
title
lightly
A
sellsword
might
get
knighted
for
fighting
well
in
a
battle
and
he
might
dishonorably
knight
all
of
his
drinking
companions
who
did
nothing
to
earn
it
They
would
technically
hold
the
title
of
knight
but
no
one
would
take
their
title
seriously
due
to
the
low
prestige
of
how
they
became
knighted
Most
often
young
men
who
have
finished
their
training
and
just
recently
been
knighted
are
landless
and
not
in
the
service
of
any
lord
There
are
three
stages
of
service
that
knights
hope
to
work
their
way
up
through
A
poor
hedge
knight
proverbially
camping
under
a
hedge
by
the
roadside
Hedge
knights
are
typically
commoners
who
have
risen
to
knighthood
They
have
no
fixed
abode
and
wander
the
Seven
Kingdoms
looking
for
a
cause
to
fight
for
They
are
disparagingly
called
hedge
knights
because
it
is
said
that
they
are
so
poor
that
they
just
sleep
under
hedges
by
the
side
of
the
road
as
they
wander
from
one
prospective
employer
to
the
next
They
frequently
travel
around
to
different
tournaments
to
show
off
their
prowess
in
the
hope
that
a
lord
in
attendance
will
then
hire
them
many
lords
do
use
tournaments
as
recruiting
grounds
though
how
well
an
individual
hedge
knight
performs
in
the
tournament
is
up
to
him
Many
consider
hedge
knights
to
be
not
much
better
than
sellswords
Sworn
swords
are
knights
sworn
to
a
particular
lord
Sometimes
this
is
permanent
but
mainly
it
is
temporary
with
hedge
knights
joining
a
lord
for
a
particular
purpose
and
then
being
released
from
his
service
afterwards
Landed
knights
are
knights
who
have
been
rewarded
for
their
service
by
a
lord
with
land
typically
a
smallholding
large
farm
or
small
manor
with
servants
They
form
the
minor
nobility
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Successful
landed
knights
who
expand
their
holdings
or
continue
to
perform
exemplary
service
for
their
liege
may
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
Lord
in
time
gaining
the
right
to
dispense
justice
on
his
lands
including
executions
without
consulting
a
higher
lord

Ser
Jaime
Lannistersrc
In
wartime
mounted
knights
form
the
backbone
of
major
armies
in
southern
Westeros
A
single
knight
is
an
elite
professional
soldier
with
extensive
combat
training
and
equipped
with
the
finest
weapons
and
heavy
armor
A
single
knight
even
dismounted
is
worth
several
dozen
poorly
armed
and
untrained
common
foot
soldiers
conscripted
as
feudal
levies
Knights
are
very
useful
for
carving
through
and
running
down
enemy
infantry
though
they
are
also
the
best
weapon
against
the
enemy
armys
own
mounted
knights
In
peacetime
knights
prove
their
martial
valor
through
training
and
contests
of
skill
known
as
tournamentsalthough
knighthood
is
not
always
a
formal
requirement
for
participation
in
a
tournament
The
highlight
of
tournaments
is
the
joust
in
which
mounted
knights
charge
at
each
other
each
knight
trying
to
knock
the
other
off
of
his
horse
using
a
wooden
lance
Knights
at
tournaments
frequently
fight
to
win
the
favor
of
noble
ladies
if
they
prove
victorious
While
some
knights
do
fight
for
such
romantic
reasons
others
are
more
interested
in
the
large
money
prizes
awarded
to
the
winners
often
consisting
of
several
hundred
to
several
thousand
Gold
Dragons
Others
fight
at
tournaments
to
win
general
social
prestige
or
for
the
excitement
of
victory
though
a
few
such
as
SerGregor
Clegane
fight
simply
because
they
enjoy
violence
Knights
often
formally
swear
fealty
to
lords
by
exchanging
formulaic
vows
In
one
commonly
used
formula
the
knight
kneels
before
a
lord
in
supplication
while
holding
up
his
sword
in
offering
and
they
give
the
following
exchange
Knight
I
offer
my
services
Lords
name
I
will
shield
your
back
and
keep
your
counsel
and
give
my
life
for
yours
if
need
be
I
swear
it
by
the
Old
Gods
and
the
New
Lord
And
I
vow
that
you
shall
always
have
a
place
by
my
hearth
and
meat
and
mead
at
my
table
And
I
pledge
to
ask
no
service
of
you
that
might
bring
you
dishonor
I
swear
it
by
the
Old
Gods
and
the
New
Arise
Men
who
have
been
knighted
even
those
not
originally
from
noble
Houses
gain
the
legal
right
to
display
their
own
personal
heraldry
Since
the
Targaryen
Conquest
three
hundred
years
before
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
the
sevenman
royal
bodyguard
known
as
the
Kingsguard
have
been
considered
to
be
the
pinnacle
of
knighthood
In
theory
the
Kingsguard
are
the
elite
of
the
elite
more
skilled
at
combat
and
more
honorable
and
virtuous
than
any
other
knights
in
the
entire
realm
At
times
this
ideal
has
been
matched
in
great
and
honorable
knights
such
as
the
legendary
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
Other
times
Kingsguard
members
have
been
skilled
warriors
but
behaved
controversially
such
as
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
In
the
worst
occasions
some
Kingsguard
members
were
appointed
simply
as
political
favors
and
are
neither
honorable
nor
particularly
talented
fighters
such
as
Ser
Meryn
Trant
Fighting
style
Mounted
Westerosi
knights
on
heavy
horse
typically
charge
enemy
infantry
formations
using
war
lances
Cavalry
charges
can
devastatingly
kill
a
large
number
of
infantry
drastically
out
of
proportion
to
the
number
of
cavalry
present
On
foot
the
fighting
style
of
Westerosi
knights
consists
of
powerful
slashing
attacks
and
strong
blocks
using
a
heavy
sword
alternating
with
quick
thrusting
attacks
meant
to
penetrate
armor
Westerosi
knights
wear
heavy
plate
armor
which
provides
them
excellent
protection
particularly
against
the
crude
weapons
of
basic
infantry
conscripts
albeit
at
the
cost
of
making
their
movements
relatively
slow
The
weight
of
their
armor
slows
them
down
enough
that
they
cannot
rely
on
speed
to
win
against
unarmored
opponents
though
the
armor
will
keep
them
alive
longer
than
their
opponent
thus
knights
must
rely
on
the
raw
power
of
blows
from
heavy
swords
designed
to
deal
damage
not
only
due
to
their
sharpness
but
their
sheer
weight
Broad
hacking
and
slashing
movements
are
not
merely
dramatic
but
combined
with
the
raw
weight
of
the
sword
will
drastically
increase
the
force
behind
the
impact
of
the
blow
A
lightly
armed
and
armored
opponent
may
hit
a
knight
multiple
times
but
for
little
damage
Conversely
it
may
take
a
knight
some
time
to
pin
down
an
unarmored
opponent
but
once
he
does
his
blow
will
be
absolutely
devastating
The
agility
of
a
knight
also
depends
highly
on
its
wearer
as
veteran
fighters
are
often
seen
to
be
moderately
unrestricted
by
their
armor
The
greatest
threat
to
armored
knights
is
actually
other
armored
knights
and
their
weapon
design
and
fighting
style
evolved
to
reflect
this
The
best
way
to
penetrate
through
plate
armor
is
with
a
thrusting
attack
using
a
long
heavy
sword
A
curved
blade
could
not
apply
as
much
pressure
on
a
single
point
and
a
thinner
blade
would
snap
under
so
much
pressure
For
comparison
the
Dothraki
arakh
sword
is
meant
to
be
used
by
light
cavalry
while
running
down
unarmored
infantry
thus
the
blade
has
a
curved
design
to
provide
greater
reach
in
slashing
attacks
which
can
be
made
very
rapidly
because
the
blade
itself
is
light
and
thin
The
arakh
was
not
designed
to
punch
through
plate
armor
however
and
at
this
task
it
pales
in
comparison
to
a
knights
straight
and
heavy
longsword
Thrusting
attacks
are
best
at
actually
penetrating
armor
but
the
sheer
force
behind
a
powerful
slashing
attack
is
often
still
quite
useful
against
even
an
armored
opponent
as
the
force
of
the
blow
may
stun
him
possibly
dent
his
armor
and
sometimes
outright
cleave
through
weaker
plate
armor
Sometimes
penetrating
a
high
quality
suit
of
armor
is
almost
impossible
even
with
strong
thrusts
In
this
case
impact
weapons
such
as
warhammers
or
maces
are
good
at
delivering
powerful
blows
that
can
crush
bones
without
actually
having
to
penetrate
the
armor
By
far
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
an
armored
opponent
is
to
simply
attack
the
areas
in
which
there
is
little
or
no
armor
Because
combat
between
Westerosi
knights
is
not
quite
as
fast
as
Dothraki
wielding
arakhs
or
the
Water
Dance
fighting
style
of
the
Free
Cities
which
uses
light
rapiers
it
values
not
only
quick
reflexes
but
strategy
Instead
of
rapid
attacks
meant
to
land
a
blow
before
the
opponent
can
react
a
Westerosi
knight
must
often
engage
in
an
elaborate
series
of
feints
trying
to
gradually
lure
the
opposing
knight
into
overcommitting
his
defense
to
one
side
then
landing
a
devastating
attack
on
the
other
side
Nonetheless
speed
is
still
very
much
a
factor
in
combat
between
knights
and
the
knight
who
is
both
physically
and
mentally
faster
will
emerge
victorious
No
one
fighting
style
is
universally
superior
to
another
simply
better
suited
to
different
purposes
and
the
skill
of
the
individual
is
often
the
ultimate
deciding
factor
in
combat
For
example
equipped
with
plate
armor
and
a
heavy
sword
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
was
able
to
defeat
Qotho
the
Dothraki
bloodrider
who
was
unarmored
and
wielding
an
arakh
Qotho
did
manage
to
land
a
strike
against
Jorahs
side
but
his
armor
absorbed
the
blow
as
a
slashing
attack
from
a
thin
blade
cannot
penetrate
plate
armor
Jorah
then
used
his
arm
to
pin
the
arakh
against
his
side
and
proceeded
to
land
a
killing
blow
with
his
own
sword
Similarly
Ser
Meryn
Trant
was
able
to
defeat
the
much
more
skilled
fighter
Syrio
Forel
because
his
armor
provided
him
complete
protection
from
all
the
blows
the
famed
First
Sword
of
Braavos
managed
to
land
with
his
leadfilled
wooden
sword
This
was
in
contrast
to
the
fates
of
several
Lannister
menatarms
who
have
tried
conclusion
with
Syrio
moments
earlier
and
had
their
jaws
and
knees
effortlessly
broken
because
they
had
no
armor
over
these
body
parts
Conversely
the
sellsword
Bronn
eschewed
heavy
armor
when
fighting
in
a
trial
by
combat
against
Ser
Vardis
Egen
Unlike
Qotho
Bronn
did
not
attempt
to
immediately
land
a
strike
on
his
opponent
but
focused
on
dodging
and
avoiding
Vardiss
attacks
until
the
knight
tired
himself
out
at
which
point
Bronn
moved
in
for
a
quick
incapacitating
strike

Ser
Royland
Degore
explains
his
ascension
to
knighthood
to
Lord
Rodrik
Forrestersrc
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
knighthood
is
an
institution
that
came
with
the
Andals
when
they
invaded
Westeros
some
six
thousand
years
ago
Knights
wore
armor
derived
from
iron
and
rode
horses
into
battle
using
massedformation
charges
and
lances
to
shatter
enemy
armies
The
devastating
effectiveness
of
this
tactic
permitted
the
Andals
to
conquer
most
of
Westeros
This
tactic
was
later
adopted
by
others
so
the
cavalry
of
the
North
uses
much
the
same
weapons
armor
and
tactics
as
knights
but
are
not
called
knights
due
to
their
devotion
to
another
god
In
practice
there
is
little
difference
between
knights
and
Northern
heavy
cavalry
There
are
several
types
of
knight
Hedge
knights
are
typically
commoners
who
have
risen
to
knighthood
They
have
no
fixed
abode
and
wander
the
Seven
Kingdoms
looking
for
a
cause
to
fight
for
They
are
called
hedge
knights
because
it
is
said
that
they
are
so
poor
that
they
just
sleep
under
hedges
by
the
side
of
the
road
as
they
wander
from
one
job
to
the
next
Sometimes
these
knights
turn
to
thievery
out
of
necessity
and
become
known
as
Robber
knights
Thus
it
is
said
than
hedge
and
robber
knights
are
two
faces
of
the
same
coin
Sworn
swords
are
knights
sworn
to
a
particular
lord
Sometimes
this
is
permanent
but
mainly
it
is
temporary
with
hedge
knights
joining
a
lord
for
a
particular
purpose
and
then
being
released
from
his
service
afterwards
Landed
knights
are
knights
who
have
been
rewarded
for
their
service
by
a
lord
with
land
typically
a
smallholding
large
farm
or
small
manor
with
servants
They
form
the
minor
nobility
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Successful
landed
knights
who
expand
their
holdings
or
continue
to
perform
exemplary
service
for
their
liege
may
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
Lord
in
time
leading
a
major
noble
House
Most
knights
pass
through
three
stages
to
achieve
the
rank
They
start
as
pages
young
boys
who
perform
menial
tasks
for
their
lieges
Pages
are
not
expected
to
fight
in
battle
but
some
do
regardless
They
are
given
lessons
in
riding
and
weapons
in
return
Upon
reaching
adolescence
pages
become
Squires
Their
training
intensifies
and
they
are
taught
the
full
comportment
and
responsibilities
of
knighthood
Squires
are
expected
to
fight
in
battle
and
carry
themselves
as
knights
at
all
times
even
though
they
have
not
achieved
the
rank
yet
They
finally
become
full
knights
after
they
have
proven
themselves
In
theory
any
knight
can
make
another
man
a
knight
though
in
practice
it
is
considered
more
prestigious
to
be
famous
and
respected
knights
particularly
those
actually
commanding
a
campaign
The
highest
honor
is
to
be
knighted
by
one
of
the
Kingsguard
There
have
been
times
when
landless
hedge
knights
of
no
merit
dubbed
dozens
of
their
followers
as
knights
simply
as
a
favor
but
this
is
considered
an
extremely
disreputable
practice
The
comparison
that
George
RR
Martin
has
used
is
that
being
knighted
is
similar
to
being
a
college
graduate
exactly
how
prestigious
your
degree
is
depends
on
where
you
received
it
Technically
a
student
at
Harvard
or
Oxford
and
a
student
at
a
local
community
college
are
both
college
graduates
but
there
is
a
drastic
difference
between
the
two
Analogously
it
is
more
prestigious
to
be
knighted
by
the
Kingsguard
or
a
famous
and
revered
knight
while
a
peasant
knighted
by
a
hedge
knight
of
no
fame
would
be
scoffed
at
as
not
being
a
real
knight
at
all
Thus
the
full
course
for
a
prospective
knight
is
PageSquireHedge
KnightSworn
SwordLanded
Knight
A
man
does
not
necessarily
have
to
go
through
the
first
two
steps
to
become
a
knight
if
a
commoner
has
significantly
distinguished
himself
in
combat
a
knight
may
choose
to
elevate
him
to
knighthood
Even
a
sellsword
that
has
fought
valiantly
in
combat
may
be
rewarded
by
being
dubbed
a
knight
though
this
is
uncommon
Further
a
soldier
who
is
rewarded
by
a
lord
for
valorous
service
by
being
dubbed
a
knight
might
instantly
be
taken
on
by
that
lord
as
a
sworn
sword
within
his
own
household
skipping
the
hedge
knight
step
Further
while
rare
it
is
not
unheard
of
for
a
lord
to
reward
a
common
soldier
not
only
by
dubbing
him
a
knight
but
by
at
the
same
time
giving
him
lands
instantly
elevating
him
from
a
simple
soldier
to
a
landed
knight
and
member
of
the
minor
nobility
skipping
the
steps
of
hedge
knight
or
sworn
sword
entirely
This
was
the
case
with
Ser
Davos
Seaworth
who
was
a
common
lowborn
smuggler
but
performed
such
valorous
service
running
the
blockade
around
Storms
End
to
bring
food
to
the
besieged
castles
starving
garrison
that
Stannis
Baratheon
rewarded
him
by
not
only
knighting
him
but
giving
him
lands
to
rule
Becoming
a
knight
requires
the
applicant
to
swear
an
oath
of
allegiance
and
fealty
to
the
Seven
and
to
stand
vigil
in
a
sept
for
a
night
these
tasks
need
not
be
performed
consecutively
it
is
not
uncommon
in
times
of
war
for
a
newlymade
knight
to
not
stand
his
vigil
for
weeks
or
months
There
is
no
formal
bar
against
women
becoming
knights
only
that
it
is
simply
not
done
There
is
no
official
rule
against
women
becoming
knights
because
it
makes
as
much
sense
in
their
culture
as
making
an
official
rule
forbidding
pigs
to
fly
it
is
absurd
and
simply
impossible
for
a
woman
to
be
a
knight
While
rare
female
warriors
have
served
as
pages
and
squires
Spelling
and
pronunciation
Ser
is
not
a
typo
the
title
for
knights
within
the
fictional
universe
of
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
book
series
is
spelled
Ser
with
an
e
not
as
sir
with
an
i
as
in
real
life
This
is
just
a
quirk
of
their
culture
In
A
Feast
for
Crows
however
it
is
once
misspelled
as
Sir
According
to
the
TV
series
official
pronunciation
guide
developed
for
the
cast
and
crew
Ser
is
pronounced
SAIR
Actors
usually
say
it
very
fast
or
slur
it
so
it
sounds
very
similar
to
the
standard
sir
but
this
is
not
the
case
That
is
actor
Sean
Bean
isnt
saying
sir
with
a
Received
Pronunciation
accent
so
it
sounds
like
SAIR
the
correct
pronunciation
of
ser
actually
is
SAIR
Writer
Bryan
Cogman
clarified
that
some
pronunciations
would
differ
due
to
the
accents
and
languages
of
the
speaker
Ser
in
particular

History
Background
House
Greyjoy

of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros
Their
lands
are
the
Iron
Islands
off
the
west
coast
of
the
continent
They
rule
from
their
castle
Pyke
from
the
island
of
the
same
name
The
Iron
Islands
are
harsh
and
bleak
and
the
Greyjoys
have
traditionally
survived
by
raiding
their
neighbors
They
have
always
had
plans
to
conquer
the
mainland
The
head
of
the
house
is
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke
House
Greyjoy
boasts
descent
from
the
Grey
King
a
legendary
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
said
to
have
ruled
for
a
thousand
years
and
taken
a
mermaid
as
his
wife
Like
the
vast
majority
of
ironborn
they
worship
theDrowned
God
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
was
the
founder
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
Iron
Islands
He
led
a
rebellion
against
King
Robert
Baratheon
eight
years
before
the
events
of
the
series
begin
Balons
sons
Rodrik
and
Maron
were
killed
in
the
unsuccessful
rebellion
Balons
only
surviving
son
Theon
was
made
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
to
ensure
Balons
submission
to
King
Robert
Only
his
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
and
two
of
his
brothers
remained
on
the
Iron
Islands
after
his
defeat
At
some
point
Balon
exiled
his
younger
brother
Euron
Greyjoy
who
became
a
feared
pirate
that
terrorized
the
seas
as
far
as
from
Oldtown
in
Westeros
to
Qarth
in
Essos
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
is
a
ward
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
He
lives
at
the
Stark
castle
of
Winterfell
where
he
has
a
cordial
relationship
with
his
Stark
hosts
Despite
the
respectful
treatment
accorded
by
the
Starks
Theon
is
insecure
about
his
status
as
a
ward
He
boasts
of
his
status
as
a
lord
to
Osha
a
Wildling
servant
in
the
Stark
household
but
fails
to
intimidate
her
He
later
accompanies
Neds
son
Robb
Stark
the
King
in
the
North
to
fight
in
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
and
wins
Robbs
trust
and
favor
Season
Theon
appeals
to
King
Robb
to
send
him
on
a
mission
to
negotiate
an
alliance
with
his
father
Balon
Greyjoy
reasoning
that
the
Starks
would
need
ships
to
attack
Kings
Landing
Despite
Catelyn
Starks
distrust
of
Balon
Robb
relents
and
sends
Theon
back
to
the
Iron
Islands
to
secure
help
However
Balon
has
other
ideas
and
plans
to
use
the
power
struggle
on
the
mainland
to
carve
up
a
kingdom
in
the
North
once
more
declaring
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
is
torn
between
his
birth
family
and
his
loyalty
to
the
Starks
but
ultimately
chooses
to
submit
to
his
father
Theon
decides
to
renege
his
allegiance
to
the
Starks
and
is
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Drowned
God
while
his
father
and
sister
watch
on
Balons
daughter
Yara
Greyjoy
leads
a
large
force
that
attacks
Deepwood
Motte
the
seat
of
House
Glover
Meanwhile
Theon
is
made
the
commander
of
the
Sea
Bitch
Instead
of
attacking
small
fishing
villages
as
ordered
Theon
and
his
men
raid
Torrhens
Square
and
succeed
in
drawing
the
remaining
Stark
forces
away
from
Winterfell
Without
consulting
Balon
or
Yara
Theon
and
his
men
seize
Winterfell
and
capture
Neds
younger
sons
Bran
and
Rickon
Stark
Theon
also
executes
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
for
defying
him
However
the
two
Stark
boys
and
their
Direwolves
escape
with
the
help
of
Osha
and
Hodor
In
retaliation
Theon
murders
two
orphans
and
claims
them
as
Bran
and
Rickon
His
actions
have
the
effect
of
fuelling
northern
hostility
towards
the
Ironborn
invaders
Balon
and
Yara
are
furious
with
Theons
conduct
which
has
jeopardized
the
Ironborn
war
effort
Yara
leads
a
party
to
implore
her
brother
to
leave
Winterfell
Theon
refuses
and
insists
on
defending
his
prize
against
the
northerners
Unable
to
reason
with
Theon
Yara
is
forced
to
leave
him
behind
Theon
and
his
paltry
garrison
are
besieged
by
a
large
Bolton
army
led
by
Ramsay
Snow
the
bastard
son
of
Roose
Bolton
a
vassal
of
the
Starks
The
Ironborn
turn
on
Theon
and
hand
him
over
to
Ramsay
in
return
for
safe
conduct
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
flays
them
alive
The
capture
of
Theon
is
a
major
blow
to
House
Greyjoy
since
it
deprives
Balon
of
his
last
remaining
son
and
heir
to
the
Seastone
Chair
Season
Over
a
prolonged
period
Theon
Greyjoy
is
tortured
and
emasculated
by
Ramsay
Snow
Due
to
his
experiences
Theon
adopts
the
persona
Reek
and
becomes
totally
subjugated
to
Ramsay
Theon
later
issues
an
ultimatum
to
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
demanding
that
he
withdraw
his
forces
from
the
North
Ramsay
also
threatens
to
send
more
bits
of
his
son
Theon
and
to
flay
every
Ironborn
in
the
North
alive
if
his
demands
are
not
met
As
a
parting
gift
Ramsay
also
presents
Theons
severed
penis
Unwilling
to
abandon
the
strongholds
he
has
taken
Balon
rejects
Ramsays
demands
He
also
rejects
his
son
Theon
because
he
disobeyed
his
orders
and
cannot
produce
heirs
to
further
the
Greyjoy
line
Defying
her
fathers
wishes
Yara
assembles
a
team
of
Ironborn
warriors
to
rescue
her
brother
Theon
Season
Theon
Greyjoy
has
seemingly
forgotten
his
former
identity
and
embraced
the
persona
Reek
He
is
totally
subservient
to
his
master
Ramsay
Upon
returning
to
the
Dreadfort
Roose
Bolton
reprimands
his
son
Ramsay
for
torturing
and
emasculating
Theon
As
Balons
son
and
heir
he
would
have
been
a
valuable
hostage
for
him
to
trade
with
Balon
in
return
for
securing
the
withdrawal
of
Ironborn
forces
from
the
North
Later
Yara
and
her
warriors
manage
to
infiltrate
the
Dreadfort
and
reach
Theons
cell
However
fearing
that
it
is
another
trap
set
up
by
his
master
Theon
spurns
Yaras
offer
Yara
and
her
warriors
are
forced
to
flee
when
Ramsay
unleashes
his
dogs
on
them
After
reaching
their
boats
Yara
regards
her
brother
Theon
to
be
dead
Having
proven
his
loyalty
Reek
is
sent
on
a
mission
by
Ramsay
to
secure
the
surrender
of
the
Ironborn
garrison
at
Moat
Cailin
For
this
mission
Reek
has
to
pretend
to
be
Theon
Identifying
himself
as
Theon
and
Balons
last
remaining
heir
Reek
addresses
the
Ironborn
garrison
telling
them
to
surrender
in
return
for
safe
passage
Despite
being
met
by
resistance
from
the
garrison
commander
Ralf
Kenning
his
men
accept
Theons
offer
and
surrender
to
the
Boltons
However
Ramsay
reneges
on
his
offer
and
has
them
flayed
alive
anyway
Season
In
an
attempt
to
reach
out
to
Theon
Sansa
Stark
reminds
him
of
his
real
name
and
position
as
Balons
only
surviving
son
and
heir
Ultimately
Theon
sheds
his
Reek
persona
and
helps
Sansa
to
escape
the
new
Bolton
stronghold
of
Winterfell
Season
After
being
rescued
from
Bolton
hunters
by
Brienne
of
Tarth
and
Podrick
Payne
Theon
decides
to
part
company
with
Sansa
and
her
companions
because
he
fears
retribution
from
Jon
Snow
for
his
role
in
the
disappearance
of
Bran
and
Rickon
and
the
murder
of
the
two
orphans
Theon
takes
one
horse
and
travels
towards
the

Meanwhile
the

face
another
major
setback

of
the
Five
Kings
over

returning
to
the

and
pushing
back
the

gains
Yara
Greyjoy
counsels
her
father
Balon
to
end
his
campaign
to
conquer
the
North
but
he
refuses
to
back
down
Later
that
night

is
murdered
by

her
father
on
the
Salt
Throne
Aeron
announces
that
a
kingsmoot
will
elect
the
new
ruler
of
the
Iron
Islands
Theon
finally
returns
to
Pyke
and
receives
a
cold
reception
from
his
sister
Yara
who
is
still
angry
at
him
for
spurning
her
rescue
attempt
at
the
Dreadfort
though
her
mood
picks
up
when
Theon
pledges
to
support
her
claim
to
the
Salt
Throne
At
the
Kingsmoot
Yara
is
able
to
win
the
support
of
many

her
reputation
as
a
warrior
and
Theons
support
Yara
promises
to
build
a
mighty
fleet

to

him
as
ruler
of
the

to

Throne
The
Greyjoys
have
ruled
ever
since
The
Greyjoys
keep
themselves
distant
from
the
other
Great
Houses
rarely
taking
part
in
events
on
the
mainland
which
they
call
the
green
lands
and
at
various
times
even
returning
to
their
ancient
practices
of

rebelled
against
the

declaring
himself
King

belief
was
that
Robert
who
had
only
been
on
the
throne
for
five
years
did
not
command
the
total
support
of
the
nobles
due
to
his
status
as
a
usurper
and
would
not
be
able
to
rally
the
support
needed
to
crush
the
rebellion
He
was
proven
wrong
and
was
defeated
with

showing
the
location
of
the
Dreadfort
on
the
continent
of
Westeros
The
Dreadfort
is
a
castle
situated
in
the
North
It
was
the
seat
of
House
Bolton
located
on
the
banks
of
the
Weeping
Water
east
of
Winterfell
The
Dreadfort
is
illomened
as
the
stronghold
of
House
Bolton
who
are
famed
for
the
flayed
skins
of
their
enemies
often
rumored
to
have
been
kept
on
display
in
the
castle
including
those
of
several
ancient
Stark
kings
However
if
such
gruesome
trophies
ever
did
exist
they
have
long
since
been
removed
or
destroyed
Following
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
House
Bolton
has
become
extinct
leaving
the
Dreadfort
without
any
ruling
lordship
However
House
Stark
only
captured
Winterfell
from
the
Boltons
No
mention
is
made
of
the
Dreadfort
being
captured
so
it
is
possible
there
is
still
a
Bolton
garrison
holding
the
castle

rebellion

History
Background
The
Dreadfort
under
siege
House
Bolton
of
the
Dreadfort
had
a
long
history
of
dissent
and
rebellion
to
the
point
were
they
became
known
as
the
Bane
of
the
North
Season
Word
of
Winterfells
capture
by
Theon
Greyjoy
reaches
the
Dreadforts
garrison
This
news
is
then
relayed
to
Roose
Bolton
via
messenger
ravens
Season
Ramsay
Snow
assists
Theon
in
escaping
from
the
Dreadfort
After
being
betrayed
by
his
crew
and
delivered
to
Ramsay
Snow
Theon
Greyjoy
is
imprisoned
in
a
torture
chamber
at
the
Dreadfort
Over
the
course
of
several
months
he
is
subjected
to
a
number
of
horrific
tortures
both
physical
and
psychological
Season
Yara
Greyjoy
leads
an
assault
on
the
Dreadfort
to
rescue
Theon
Greyjoy
The
assault
ends
in
failure
when
Yara
and
her
fellow
ironborn
cannot
convince
Theon
now
Reek
that
they
are
his
rescue
party
Ramsay
the
Bastards
Girls
and
his
fellow
Dreadfort
menatarms
repel
the
ironborn
raiders
Following
the
Surrender
of
Moat
Cailin
the
Boltons
take
Winterfell
the
traditional
capital
of
the
North
for
their
new
seat
leaving
The
Dreadfort
in
the
hands
of
a
handful
of
Bolton
men
and
a
Castellan
Presumbly
Roose
planned
on
giving
The
Dreadfort
to
his
and
Waldas
child
while
Ramsays
child
would
get
Winterfell
Season
Following
the
deaths
of
Roose
Bolton
Walda
Bolton
and
their
newborn
child
at
the
hands
of
Ramsay
Bolton
the
Dreadfort
passed
to
Ramsay
Not
long
after
however
Ramsay
was
defeated
and
nearly
beaten
to
death
by
Jon
Snow
at
the
Battle
of
the
Bastards
and
then
fed
to
his
own
hounds
by
his
wife
Sansa
Stark
Thus
with
House
Bolton
having
been
cast
down
and
extinguished
the
Dreadfort
has
no
current
lord
However
it
appears
that
Sansa
Stark
by
her
marriage
to
Ramsay
Bolton
is
the
rightful
Lady
of
the
Dreadfort
according
to
Westerosi
law
It
is
possible
there
is
a
Bolton
garrison
stationed
at
the
Dreadfort
in
rebellion
against
House
Stark

Dreadfort
in
the
fourth
season
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
the
Dreadfort
has
a
similar
history
of
dissent
and
rebellion
Three
centuries
after
the
founding
of
Karhold
the
Starks
finally
crushed
the
Boltons
in
a
war
that
saw
the
Dreadfort
besieged
for
two
years
The
Dreadfort
is
a
strong
fortress
with
high
walls
and
triangular
merlons
that
look
like
sharp
stone
teeth
It
has
thick
stone
walls
and
massive
towers
Its
great
hall
is
dim
and
smoky
with
rows
of
torches
grasped
by
skeletal
human
hands
jutting
from
the
walls
Long
tables
stand
before
a
dais
with
a
high
table
The
hall
has
a
vaulted
ceiling
and
wooden
rafters
turned
black

General
Author
George
RR
Martin
has
stated
that
the
storyline
in
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
is
partially
and
loosely
inspired
by
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
the
dynastic
conflict
that
occurred
in
England
intermittently
between
and
following
the
countrys
defeat
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
as
well
as
Maurice
Druons
novels
The
Accursed
Kings
about
the
history
of
the
French
Kings
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
Hundred
Years
War
Just
as
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
were
fought
between
the
Yorks
and
Lancasters
the
conflict
in
Game
of
Thrones
is
between
the
Starks
and
Lannisters
The
technology
level
in
their
society
more
or
less
matches
late
medieval
Europe
ie
right
before
the
use
of
gunpowder
and
cannons
revolutionized
medieval
warfare
and
brought
it
into
the
Early
Modern
era
Magic
was
prevalent
in
the
world
in
the
longdistant
past
but
for
many
centuries
magical
power
has
dwindled
in
the
world
as
has
knowledge
of
its
use
While
a
handful
of
odd
cults
still
believe
in
magic
such
as
the
Alchemists
GuildandWarlocks
of
Qarth
they
can
do
little
to
substantiate
their
claims
The
general
population
considers
magic
to
have
never
existed
at
all
and
to
be
simply
mythical
a
view
promoted
by
the
Order
of
Maesters
who
champion
a
world
based
on
science
and
reason
and
scorn
the
very
idea
of
magic
The
mighty
Valyrian
Freehold
was
built
using
the
powerful
dragons
who
were
rumored
to
share
a
deep
link
with
magic
However
most
dragons
were
killed
in
the
Doom
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
before
the
narrative
of
Game
of
Thrones
begins
and
even
the
last
dragons
which
belonged
to
House
Targaryen
died
almost
two
centuries
ago
largely
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
Science
and
technology
have
not
significantly
advanced
in
the
past
several
centuries
Recorded
history
is
indeed
vastly
longer
in
the
fantasy
world
than
in
reallife
For
example
the
Valyrian
Freehold
existed
for
an
astonishing
five
thousand
years
before
its
fall
Written
history
in
Westeros
began
with
the
Andal
Invasion
six
thousand
years
ago
albeit
much
of
this
is
fragmentary
and
biased
see
main
article
Timeline
It
is
possible
that
in
earlier
ages
when
magic
was
more
prevalent
there
was
less
drive
to
innovate
new
tools
with
science
leaving
technology
levels
static
for
many
centuries
Even
so
while
the
general
rule
holds
that
gunpowder
has
not
been
discovered
there
is
not
a
oneforone
correspondence
between
the
technology
level
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
and
the
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
For
example
certain
medical
knowledge
is
much
more
advanced
and
accurate
in
Westeros
than
it
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
partially
because
certain
discoveries
in
history
have
been
accidental
ie
penicillin
not
the
culmination
of
a
long
aggregation
of
previous
discoveries
The
people
in
Westeros
and
beyond
are
also
capable
of
producing
vast
feats
of
architecture
such
as
the
Red
Keep
in
Kings
Landing
without
the
use
of
magic
at
all
Martin
has
stated
that
medical
knowledge
is
officially
more
advanced
in
Westeros
than
in
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
I
made
a
deliberate
decision
when
the
books
began
to
have
the
maesters
and
have
Westeros
in
general
have
better
medical
knowledge
than
the
reallife
Middle
Ages
Mostly
because
I
didnt
want
everybody
dying
at
twentysix
So
it
is
generally
improved
the
maesters
have
improved
the
standard
of
hygiene
and
they
understand
certain
practices
and
they
can
do
things
better
Also
they
have
magic
While
this
might
seem
incongruent
with
the
otherwise
static
medieval
level
of
technology
in
Westeros
much
of
reallife
medical
knowledge
was
discovered
purely
through
trial
and
error
or
even
by
accident
such
as
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
The
maesters
might
not
know
the
underlying
theoretical
reasons
behind
illnesses
what
bacteria
and
viruses
are
but
they
have
accumulated
a
more
advanced
level
of
functional
medical
knowledge
for
practical
purposes
such
as
what
herb
mixtures
will
heal
infections
better
surgical
procedures
etc
Medicine

Armament
Military
technology
in
Westeros
and
Essos
is
loosely
comparable
to
the
kinds
used
during
the
reallife
Hundred
Years
War
and
War
of
the
Roses
Crossbows
are
prevalent
though
they
have
not
superseded
longbows
which
are
also
quite
common
on
the
battlefield
again
much
like
the
s
in
reallife
northwestern
Europe
Various
kinds
of
advanced
siege
weapons
such
as
catapults
are
employed
Horse
cavalry
are
widely
used
and
some
regions
of
Essos
are
known
to
use
mounted
elephants
Heavy
cavalry
using
mounted
knights
in
full
plate
armor
is
a
mainstay
of
the
battlefield
though
they
are
more
commonly
fielded
by
the
wealthier
regions
of
Westeros
ie
the
Reach
or
the
Westerlands
while
the
poorer
kingdoms
such
as
The
North
or
the
Iron
Islands
make
do
with
chain
mail
instead
of
full
plate
armor
Many
armies
frequently
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
mercenaries
Valyrian
steel
is
a
type
of
metal
forged
in
the
oncemighty
Valyrian
Freehold
used
to
make
swords
that
are
exceptionally
sharp
and
tremendously
strong
The
knowledge
of
how
to
create
Valyrian
steel
was
lost
in
the
fall
of
Valyria
four
hundred
years
ago
making
the
few
surviving
Valyrian
steel
swords
incredibly
rare
and
expensive
Valyrian
steel
is
rumored
to
have
been
forged
with
the
aid
of
magic
spells
and
dragonfire
Gunpowder
does
not
exist
in
the
medieval
fantasy
world
of
Westeros
They
do
possess
Wildfire
a
highly
flammable
and
explosive
napalmlike
substance
the
Alchemists
Guild
refuses
to
divulge
how
wildfire
is
created
but
claim
that
it
is
done
with
magical
spells
a
claim
dismissed
by
others
particularly
the
maesters
Even
so
Wildfire
is
similar
to
real
life
Greek
fire
which
was
actually
used
by
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
medieval
times
and
thus
was
actually
a
technology
known
to
medieval
peoples
and
thus
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
for
a
medieval
setting
Dragons
were
of
course
used
in
warfare
but
they
are
more
of
a
magicbased
fantasy
creature
Moreover
the
last
known
dragons
in
the
world
died
out
two
hundred
years
ago
largely
due
to
many
of
them
being
used
up
in
a
Targaryen
civil
war
known
as
the
Dance
of
Dragons
in
which
dragons
were
used
to
kill
other
dragons
Thus
dragons
have
not
been
used
on
the
battlefield
in
two
centuries

Currency
Several
different
types
of
currency
are
used
in
the
worlds
various
economies
The
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros
have
a
uniform
system
of
coinage
based
on
the
Gold
Dragon
coin
The
different
cities
and
nations
across
the
Narrow
Sea
on
Essos
use
their
own
various
local
currencies
Books
and
writing
Different
societies
have
their
own
writing
systems
The
main
one
encountered
is
the
one
used
for
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Andals
throughout
Westeros
The
Andals
introduced
the
first
full
writing
system
to
Westeros
the
First
Men
before
them
only
used
a
basic
rune
script
for
the
Old
Tongue
which
was
only
used
for
basic
inscriptions
on
grave
markers
etc
The
Dothraki
do
not
have
a
written
language
In
the
novels
it
is
stated
that
the
Valyrian
languages
in
the
Free
Cities
and
Slavers
Bay
have
their
own
glyphbased
writing
systems
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
represent
this
in
the
TV
series
The
novels
refer
to
characters
in
Westeros
using
both
parchment
made
from
animal
skins
and
paper
made
from
wood
pulp
This
is
not
incongruous
to
the
setting
paper
was
introduced
to
real
life
Western
Europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
though
it
did
not
surpass
use
of
parchment
for
many
centuries
Generally
parchment
was
still
used
for
important
documents
legal
charters
important
diplomatic
messages
etc
while
paper
was
a
cheap
less
durable
alternative
Given
that
Westeros
is
loosely
based
on
the
War
of
the
Roses
in
England
during
the
s
it
is
not
contradictory
that
their
society
uses
a
mix
of
paper
or
parchment
for
different
tasks
Paper
seems
to
be
often
used
for
more
common
tasks
the
messages
sent
via
the
raven
network
are
described
as
being
written
on
little
scrolls
of
paper
paper
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
parchment
so
it
is
probably
easier
to
roll
easier
to
fit
more
writing
on
each
roll
and
easier
for
the
birds
to
carry
More
important
handdelivered
messages
tend
to
be
written
on
parchment
particularly
royal
decrees
from
Kings
Landing
Most
if
not
all
books
are
made
out
of
parchment
not
paper
books
are
usually
commissioned
or
handcopied
and
thus
more
like
luxury
items
so
anyone
commissioning
one
will
have
it
made
of
high
quality
They
dont
have
cheap
massproduced
paper
books
No
mention
has
been
made
of
printing
press
technology
and
it
apparently
doesnt
exist
in
Westeros
and
probably
not
in
Essos
either
The
printing
press
was
only
introduced
in
reallife
Medieval
Europe
in
the
mids
and
took
time
to
be
implemented
again
matching
the
general
historical
period
of
the
setting
It
is
unknown
if
other
societies
use
earlier
forms
of
printing
such
as
woodblock
printing
etc

Measurement
Measurements
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
both
the
books
and
TV
series
are
given
in
imperial
measurements
As
they
are
a
medieval
society
their
systems
of
measurements
weights
and
coinage
grew
haphazardly
out
of
local
customs
instead
of
any
rational
basis
For
example
the
Wall
is
miles
long
and
feet
tall
converted
to
the
metric
system
for
the
benefit
of
some
viewers
the
Wall
is
kilometers
long
and
between
and
meters
tall
Weights
are
rarely
mentioned
in
the
TV
series
but
it
has
been
said
that
pounds
tons
and
ounces
are
used
to
measure
them
These
are
also
nonmetric
units
as
kilograms
do
not
exist
as
a
unit
in
Westeros
in
the
books
the
old
nonmetric
unit
of
stones
is
also
used
one
stone
equals
about
pounds
Smaller
distances
can
be
measured
in
yards
Animals
and
Plants
See
main
article
Animals
and
Plants
Several
notable
animal
and
plant
species
exist
in
Westeros
and
the
Known
World
Some
of
these
have
no
real
world
counterparts
but
many
are
based
on
ice
age
megafauna
which
did
exist
in
reallife
but
went
extinct
thousands
of
years
ago
On
the
whole
it
is
very
unusual
to
encounter
animals
that
are
significantly
different
than
encountered
in
reallife
medieval
Europe
and
the
Near
East
A
few
animals
have
no
oneforone
counterpart
with
real
life
ones
ie
shadowcats
are
common
animals
somewhere
in
size
between
a
cougar
and
a
tiger
but
not
exactly
like
either
In
general
however
even
direwolves
are
a
very
rare
and
unusual
animal
for
the
inhabitants
of
Westeros
to
encounter
in
keeping
with
George
RR
Martins
attempts
to
create
a
more
realistic
gritty
fantasy
world
Animals
Dragons
winged
reptiles
of
tremendous
age
and
ferocity
capable
of
breathing
fire
Originated
in
the
east
and
enslaved
by
the
Valyrians
who
used
them
to
forge
their
empire
Most
dragons
were
destroyed
in
the
Doom
four
centuries
ago
leaving
the
few
possessed
by
House
Targaryen
as
the
only
surviving
dragons
in
the
world
which
they
used
in
their
invasion
of
Westeros
The
last
Targaryen
dragons
died
over
years
ago
The
skulls
of
more
than
a
dozen
dragons
are
kept
in
the
Red
Keep
Direwolves
a
larger
cousin
of
regular
wolves
only
found
north
of
the
Wall
In
the
south
they
are
considered
nearmythical
Occasional
sightings
of
direwolves
have
been
reported
by
the
Nights
Watch
but
at
the
time
the
series
starts
there
have
been
no
confirmed
sightings
south
of
the
Wall
for
centuries
Horses
A
common
animal
bred
all
over
Westeros
commonly
used
as
methods
of
transport
Krakens
massive
cephalopods
that
stalk
the
worlds
oceans
So
rare
that
they
are
largely
held
to
be
mythical
though

occasionally
report
seeing

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
is
a

exiled
Northern
lord
from
Westeros
previously
living
in
Essos
He
has
sworn
fealty
to
his
fellow
exile
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
was
the
first
to
help
her
adapt
to
life
as
a
Khaleesi
of
the
Dothraki

working
as

He
develops
strong
and
unrequited
feelings
for

History
Background
Jorah
fighting
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
Jorah
Mormont
is
the
son
of
Jeor
Mormont
of
House
Mormont
the
Lords
of
Bear
Island
and
vassals
of
House
Stark
in
the
North
Jorah
had
a
distinguished
early
career
and
participating
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
during
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
for
which
he
was
knighted
by
King
Robert
Baratheon
His
father
later
voluntarily
joined
the
Nights
Watch
leaving
Jorah
as
Lord
of
Bear
Island
and
head
of
House
Mormont
Jorah
married
Lynesse
Hightower
but
his
new
wife
had
expensive
tastes
that
Jorah
struggled
to
fund
Ultimately
he
resorted
to
selling
poachers
into
slavery
which
has
been
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
millennia
and
is
a
great
taboo
throughout
Westeros
Jorah
was
caught
and
disgraced
He
was
stripped
of
his
Lordship
and
fled
to
the
Free
Cities
to
avoid
being
executed
by
Eddard
Stark
though
he
left
his
familys
ancestral
sword
Longclaw
behind
his
father
would
eventually
pass
it
on
to
Jon
Snow
He
served
in
mercenary
companies
such
as
the
Golden
Company
His
wife
eventually
left
him
for
another
richer
man
He
is
called
Jorah
the
Andal
by
the
Dothraki
as
they
assume
that
all
people
from
Westeros
are
Andals
However
Jorah
is
actually
a
Northman
descended
from
the
First
Men
Besides
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros
Ser
Jorah
is
fluent
in
the
Dothraki
language
Season
Daenerys
and
Jorah
Mormont
in
the
Dothraki
sea
Jorah
appears
at
the
wedding
of
Khal
Drogo
and
Daenerys
Targaryen
He
introduces
himself
and
presents
Daenerys
with
some
books
containing
songs
and
stories
from
Westeros
He
tells
her
that
he
served
her
father
for
many
years
and
pledges
to
serve
the
rightful
king
her
brother
Viserys
While
traveling
to
Vaes
Dothrak
Ser
Jorah
tells
Viserys
that
he
lost
his
home
because
he
sold
some
poachers
to
slavers
which
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Eddard
Stark
wanted
to
execute
him
for
breaking
the
law
He
fled
instead
Viserys
dismisses
the
charges
as
foolishness
saying
such
things
will
be
tolerated
under
his
rule
Mormont
is
less
certain
that
this
will
happen
Ser
Jorah
is
impressed
by
Daeneryss
growing
ability
to
command
When
Viserys
tries
to
hit
Daenerys
she
is
defended
by
her
bodyguard
Rakharo
who
asks
her
if
she
wants
Viserys
killed
She
commands
that
no
harm
come
to
him
Viserys
orders
Ser
Jorah
to
kill
Daenerys
men
a
suicidal
order
that
Jorah
pointedly
ignores
from
this
point
on
he
is
under
Daeneryss
command
Rakharo
orders
Viseryss
horse
taken
so
he
has
to
walk
a
disgrace
for
a
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Rakharo
debate
combat
techniques
Jorah
talks
to
Rakharo
and
helps
him
learn
some
Westerosi
words
to
better
serve
her
Jorah
and
Rakharo
also
swap
their
opinions
on
the
value
of
swords
and
armors
versus
the
arakh
and
some
personal
information
Jorah
states
that
his
father
is
a
man
of
great
honor
and
integrity
and
that
Jorahs
disgrace
betrayed
him
When
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
he
rides
to
the
nearby
Free
City
of
Qohor
It
is
later
revealed
that
he
sent
information
to
Varys
in
Kings
Landing
about
Daeneryss
pregnancy
Arriving
at
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
asks
Jorah
if
he
thinks
the
Dothraki
could
retake
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
her
House
Mormont
points
out
the
difficulties
of
persuading
them
to
cross
the
Narrow
Sea
but
believes
success
would
be
possible
if
that
could
be
accomplished
and
if
King
Robert
was
foolish
enough
to
meet
them
in
open
battle
He
says
that
if
their
opponents
retreated
behind
stone
walls
the
Dothraki
would
not
be
able
to
root
them
out
They
move
to
discussing
Jorahs
background
and
he
admits
to
selling
the
poachers
as
slaves
to
raise
money
for
his
expensive
wife
When
Daenerys
asks
him
where
his
wife
is
Jorah
replies
that
she
is
with
another
man
in
another
place
Jorah
warning
Viserys
In
Kings
Landing
Eddard
Stark
learns
that
Jorah
Mormont
is
Varyss
agent
and
spy
in
Daeneryss
retinue
He
puts
little
faith
in
Jorahs
information
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
considering
him
a
traitor
who
will
say
anything
for
a
royal
pardon
However
King
Robert
and
his
council
are
adamant
that
his
information
can
be
relied
on
and
order
the
assassination
of
Daenerys
Jorah
translates
for
the
benefit
of
Viserys
during
the
ceremony
where
Daenerys
eats
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
Dosh
khaleen
can
prophesize
about
her
baby
Viserys
thinks
it
is
disgusting
but
when
he
realizes
that
the
Dothraki
love
Daenerys
he
slips
away
Jorah
follows
and
finds
him
trying
to
steal
Daeneryss
three
dragon
eggs
He
is
tired
of
waiting
and
he
wants
to
sell
the
eggs
to
buy
an
army
Viserys
accuses
Jorah
of
having
desires
for
his
sister
but
Jorah
still
stops
him
from
leaving
using
a
variation
of
the
motto
of
his
house
Yet
here
I
stand
Viserys
backs
down
and
leaves
without
the
eggs
Later
when
Viserys
threatens
Daenerys
Jorah
tries
to
stop
him
as
drawing
blood
in
the
sacred
city
is
punishable
by
death
When
Drogo
executes
Viserys
with
a
pot
of
molten
gold
he
urges
Daenerys
to
look
away
but
she
refuses
Ser
Jorah
foils
the
assassination
attempt
of
the
Wineseller
in
the
markets
of
Vaes
Dothrak
Jorah
accompanies
Daenerys
and
her
handmaidens
to
the
market
He
receives
a
message
from
a
lad
one
of
Varyss
informers
that
he
calls
his
Little
Birds
who
says
the
Spider
sends
his
regards
and
hands
him
a
parchment
which
he
says
is
his
pardon
and
he
can
go
home
now
Ser
Jorah
clutches
it
and
looks
at
it
with
longing
but
realizes
it
means
that
if
they
dont
need
anyone
to
spy
on
Daenerys
anymore
she
is
likely
in
danger
He
goes
back
to
the
market
and
seeing
a
wineseller
trying
to
give
Daenerys
a
cask
as
a
gift
he
intervenes
and
prevents
the
assassination
as
the
wine
is
poisoned
Drogo
rewards
his
loyalty
with
a
horse
of
his
choosing
before
vowing
to
invade
and
seize
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
vengeance
Ser
Jorah
accompanies
Daenerys
as
the
khalasar
raids
the
lands
of
Lhazar
When
Daenerys
orders
that
Dothraki
warriors
are
to
be
prevented
from
raping
the
local
women
Ser
Jorah
helps
carry
out
the
order
upsetting
the
Dothraki
He
witnesses
the
fight
between
Drogo
and
Mago
Drogo
wins
but
takes
a
small
wound
Ser
Jorah
carries
Daenerys
to
the
tent
As
Drogos
condition
worsens
Ser
Jorah
fears
for
the
chaos
that
will
be
unleashed
if
he
dies
Daenerys
is
shocked
to
learn
that
her
unborn
son
will
be
killed
in
the
resulting
power
struggle
as
different
bloodriders
fight
to
succeed
Drogo
Jorah
suggests

leave
quietly
and

where
there
is
a
port

Daenerys
refuses
She
begs
the
Lhazareen
witch
Mirri
Maz
Duur
to
help
Drogo
with
blood
magic
and
tells
Ser
Jorah
that
he
should
put
on
his
armor
When
Drogos
bloodrider
Qotho
tries
to
halt
the
ceremony
Ser
Jorah
stops
him
with
his
sword
They
fight
and
the
younger
Dothraki
swiftly
gains
the
upper
hand
through
his
superior
agility
but
his
arakh
is
unable
to
penetrate
Jorahs
heavy
armor
allowing
Jorah
to
kill
him
Daenerys
goes
into
labor
but
the
midwives
are
too
afraid
to
help
her
thinking
she
is
cursed
because
of
the
maegi
Jorah
takes
her
into
Drogos
tent
to
seek
Duurs
aid
Jorah
is
with
Daenerys
when
she
wakes
the
next
morning
He
tells
her
to
rest
but
she
insists
on
being
taken
to
Drogo
and
her
child
She
learns
that
her
son
was
stillborn
badly
malformed
and
that
Drogo
is
alive
but
comatose
while
the
khalasar
has
scattered
to
the
winds
Duur
admits
that
she
orchestrated

condition
and
the
death
of
Daeneryss
son
as
vengeance
for
the
destruction
of
her
village
Daenerys
ends
Drogos
suffering
by
smothering
him
with
a
pillow
Jorah
tries
to
prevent
Daenerys
from
stepping
onto
the
pyre
She
builds
a
funeral
pyre
for
Drogo
has
her
dragon
eggs
placed
on
the
pyre
and
has
Jorah
bind
Duur
to
the
pyre
so
that
she
may
burn
alive
Ser
Jorah
tries
to
stop
Daenerys
from
burning
the
dragon
eggs
as
they
can
be
sold
to
buy
her
a
life
of
travel
to
exotic
places
He
tells
her
he
knows
she
is
planning
on
stepping
onto
the
pyre
as
well
and
says
she
must
not
She
strokes
his
cheek
and
gives
a
speech
to
her
people
saying
that
they
may
go
but
if
they
stay
she
will
lead
them
to
a
great
destiny
She
then
walks
into
the
flames
as
the
remaining
Dothraki
kneel
in
reverence
Jorah
and
Daeneryss
remaining
khalasar
stand
vigil
all
night
until
the
fire
finally
burns
out
In
the
morning
they
find
Daenerys
unhurt
among
the
ashes
with
three
newlyhatched
dragons
A
stunned
Jorah
drops
to
his

and
proclaims
Daenerys
his
queen
and
liege

and
her

After
Danys
mare
Drogos
first
gift
to
her
dies
of
exhaustion
she
wonders
where
should
they
go
and
what
can
she
do
against
starvation
Jorah
reminds
her
that
returning
either
to
Lhazar
or
to
the
Dothraki
sea
would
mean
their
death
and
the
loss
of
her
dragons
at
the
hands
of
either
the
Lhazareen
or
another
khalasar
He
also
reminds

for
her
peoples
sake

inside
Jorah
warns
Daenerys
not
to
look
but
she
insists
She
asks
Jorah
who
killed
Rakharo
and
he
speculates
it
might
have
been
another

or
Khal
Jhaqo
who
are

He
reports

have
invited
Daenerys
to
the
city
Daenerys
asks
Jorah
what
he
knows
of
Qarth
and
he
tells
her
that
the
desert
around
it
is
known
as
the
Garden
of

it
is
littered

reacts
in
anger
despite

to
be
careful
Nevertheless

Xaro
offers
to
fund

in
exchange
for
her
hand
in
marriage
Later
she
seeks
Jorahs
advice
about
the
proposal
and
he
cautions
against
accepting
financial
aid
He
suggests
that
she
will
be
able
to
win
her
throne
should
she
reach
Westeros
with
just
a
single
ship
He
accidentally
reveals
his
depth
of
feeling
for
her
and
while
she
accepts
his
counsel
she
looks
away
and
does
not
reciprocate
While

is
away
seeking
a
ship
Daenerys
appeals

He
finds

appealing
to

they
all
deny

admits
to
taking
them
to
the
House
of
the
Undying
as
part
of
a
deal
struck
with
Xaro
who
has
proclaimed
himself
king

insists
on
reclaiming

dragons
saying
that
they
are
her
children
She
reminds
Jorah
that

has
magic
of

agrees
to
help
her
despite
knowing
they
will
be
walking
into
a
trap
Jorah
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
confront
Xaro
While
searching
for
an
entrance
into
the
House
of
the
Undying
Daenerys
is
magically
transported
inside
leaving
a
distraught
Jorah
calling
for
her
outside
Daenerys
overcomes
the
warlocks
spells
and
reunites
with
her
dragons
Once
they
are
together
she
commands
them
to
breathe
flames
at

sorcerer
killing
him
and
allowing

Season
Jorah
is
on
Daeneryss
ship
that
sailed
from
Qarth
to
Astapor
He
is
also
with
her
when
Kraznys
mo
Nakloz
demonstrates
the
level
of
obedience
of
his
Unsullied
soldiers
by
slicing
off
one
of
their
nipples
and
urges
her
to
purchase
them
During
the
conversation
Daenerys
finds
herself
distracted
by
a
young
girl
playing
with
a
ball
A
cloaked
stranger
appears
from
behind
them
to
knock
the
ball
out
of
her
hands
and
Jorah
engages
in
a
struggle
with
him
The
ball
hits
the
floor
and
cracks
open
to
reveal
a
manticore
which
the
stranger
promptly
stabs
with
his
dagger
When
he
removes
his
hood
Jorah
recognizes
him
as
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
who
pledges
fealty
to
her
Jorah
and
Kovarro
in
the
season
premiere
Valar
Dohaeris
Jorah
reaches
the
Walk
of
Punishment
with
Daenerys
and
Ser
Barristan
He
and
Ser
Barristan
debate
the
merits
of
buying
the
Unsullied
Barristan
advises
Daenerys
that
there
is
no
honor
in
conquering
with
a
purchased
slave
army
Jorah
counters
that
honor
does
not
win
battles
and
that
the
Unsullied
are
not
like
a
regular
army
They
will
not
rape
and
pillage
and
will
only
kill
who
they
are
ordered
to
kill
Daenerys
eventually
offers
one
of
her
dragons
to
Kraznys
in
return
for
all
of
his
Unsullied
a
deal
that
Jorah
and
Barristan
both
strongly
advise
her
against
Nevertheless
Daenerys
stands
her
ground
and
scolds
her
two
advisors
for
contradicting
her
in
public
Jorah
is
present
at
the
Sack
of
Astapor
where
Daenerys
manages
to
both
keep
all
of
her
dragons
and
win
the
army
as
well
as
their
trust
in
her
as
a
queen
and
not
as
a
mistress
effectively
getting
the
best
out
of
both
Jorah
and
Barristans
prior
arguments
On
the
road
north
to
Yunkai
Jorah
reminisces
with
Barristan
about
the
day
he
was
knighted
by
King
Robert
for
his
part
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
He
recalls
that
the
only
thing
on
his
mind
was
how
badly
he
needed
to
urinate
having
been
sealed
in
armor
for
sixteen
hours
Barristan
prods
Jorah
about
his
past
when
he
was
disgraced
and
exiled
for
his
involvement
in
the
slave
trade
and
warns
him
that
his
presence
alongside
Daenerys
may
harm
her
image
in
Westeros
Jorah
questions
Barristan
about
the
advisors
on
King
Roberts
Small
Council
subtly
trying
to
ascertain
whether
Barristan
knows
that
he
was
previously
spying
on
Daenerys
for
Varys
However
Barristan
explains
that
as
a
former
Targaryen
loyalist
King
Robert
did
not
fully
trust
him
and
excluded
him
from
council
meetings
Jorah
and
Barristan
briefly
bicker
about
the
fact
that
Barristan
has
only
just
arrived
while
Jorah
has
been
protecting
Daenerys
for
months
Jorah
tells
Barristan
that
he
is
not
Lord
Commander
here
and
he
only
takes
orders
from
Daenerys
Upon
arriving
at
Yunkais
gates
Jorah
is
dismissive
of
Daeneryss
and
Barristans
claims
that
its
reputation
for
training
bed
slaves
rather
than
soldiers
will
give
them
a
clear
advantage
and
explains
that
Yunkai
will
in
all
likelihood
just
shut
its
gates
and
chip
away
at
Daeneryss
army
using
guerilla
tactics
He
also
advises
Dany
that
conquering
Yunkai
is
irrelevant
in
their
quest
to
return
to
Westeros
but
she
is
adamant
on
freeing
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
slaves
within
the
city
walls
Jorah
is
present
in
Daeneryss
tent
when
the
Yunkish
slavetrader
Razdal
mo
Eraz
arrives
bearing
gifts
Following
her
orders
he
spies
on
the
mercenary
group
the
Second
Sons
and
is
again
present
in
her
tent
when
she
is
hosting
the
two
mercenary
captains
Mero
and
Prendahl
na
Ghezn
and
their
lieutenant
Daario
Naharis
Mero
is
sexually
vulgar
towards
Daenerys
which
prompts
Ser
Jorah
to
threaten
him
to
mind
his
tongue
With
Daarios
help
Jorah
and
Grey
Worm
enter
Yunkai
from
one
of
its
posterior
tunnels
and
the
three
of
them
successfully
fight
off
a
number
of
guards
and
open
the
gates
of
Yunkai
from
the
inside
allowing
the
Unsullied
to
sweep
in
and
win
the
city
for
Daenerys
Jorah
however
is
noticably
distraught
when
all
of
Daeneryss
postvictory
attention
is
centered
on
Daario
Jorah
along
with
Ser
Barristan
Daario
and
Missandei
is
also
present
when
Daenerys
is
greeted
with
open
arms
by
the
newly
freed
slaves
of
Yunkai
Season
While
feeding
her
dragons
Dany
is
warned
by
Jorah
once
again
about
the
fact
that
they
are
not
tameable
beasts
He
also
informs
her
that
Daario
Naharis
and
Grey
Worm
are
gambling
When
the
army
of
Unsullied
halts
in
unison
Jorah
faces
the
crucifixion
of
a
small
child
one
of
along
the
path
to
Meereen
greatest
of
the
cities
of
Slavers
Bay
As
the
one
who
has
been
at
her
side
the
longest
Ser
Jorah
volunteers
to
face
the
champion
sent
out
by
Meereen
when
Daenerys
arrives
at
their
gates
Daenerys
refuses
to
gamble
with
the
life
of
her
most
trusted
advisor
general
and
dearest
friend
Ser
Jorah
is
confronted
by
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
regarding
Mormonts
royal
pardon
Ser
Jorah
informs
Daenerys
that
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
has
been
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
He
also
informs
her
of
the
disasters
in
the
two
cities
she
liberated
Yunkai
and
Astapor
Daeneryss
companions
debate
about
possibly
mounting
an
invasion
of
Westeros
due
to
its
current
state
Jorah
is
against
it
stating
that
their
forces
could
not
conquer
all
of
Westeros
alone
and
they
have
no
real
allies
on
the
continent
After
Daenerys
dismisses
the
rest
of
her
council
she
tells
Jorah
that
her
business
in
Slavers
Bay
is
not
yet
complete
and
intends
to
stay
Some
weeks
later
Jorah
enters
Daeneryss
chambers
early
in
the
morning
and
is
not
pleased
to
find
a
partiallydressed
Daario
exiting
Daario
quips
that
it
is
a
good
time
to
petition
Daenerys
because
she
is
in
a
very
good
mood
Entering
the
queens
conference
room
he
expresses
his
distrust
for
Daario
insinuating
that
Daario
only
murdered
his
superiors
and
joined
forces
with
Daenerys
out
of
lust
and
thus
is
not
a
trustworthy
ally
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
she
sent
Daario
to
take
the
Second
Sons
to
Yunkai
to
regain
control
over
the
city
and
kill
the
masters
that
have
resurfaced
Jorah
relates
to
the
mercy
shown
by
Eddard
Stark
for
his
dealings
in
slavery
and
convinces
Daenerys
to
bring
the
masters
to
justice
without
execution
Daenerys
considers
for
a
moment
and
then
tells
Jorah
to
assign
Hizdahr
zo
Loraq
as
her
ambassador
to
offer
the
masters
a
choice
they
can
live
free
in
the
new
world
she
wants
to
create
or
they
can
die
clinging
to
their
old
one
The
Second
Sons
will
be
stationed
in
Yunkai
to
enforce
whichever
choice
the
masters
make
She
also
says
to
let
Daario
know
that
it
was
Jorah
who
changed
her
mind
Daenerys
banishes
Ser
Jorah
from
her
service
As
Barristan
Selmy
watches
the
Unsullied
taking
down
the
crucified
slave
masters
outside
of
Meereen
a
small
boy
approaches
him
giving
him
a
scroll
bearing
the
seal
of
the
kings
hand
As
Barristan
reads
it
he
realizes
that
the
letter
was
signed
by
Robert
Baratheon
the
same
year
Jorah
and
Daenerys
first
met
each
other
Barristan
confronts
Jorah
about
this
before
telling
Daenerys
saying
that
he
doesnt
want
to
go
behind
Jorahs
back
He
tells
Jorah
that
he
knows
the
truth
Jorah
was
intially
working
as
a
spy
for
Robert
As
Jorah
asks
to
speak
with
Daenerys
alone
Barristan
tells
him
you
will
never
be
alone
with
her
again
In
the
throne
room
as
Jorah
walks
up
the
steps
towards
Daenerys
the
tension
mounts
when
she
asks
for
an
explanation
Jorah
explains
that
the
situation
is
a
ploy
by
TywinLannister
in
order
to
divide
them
However
as
the
scroll
was
signed
the
year
Jorah
first
met
Daenerys
she
asks
if
the
pardon
was
forged
Reluctantly
Jorah
tells
the
truth
at
Daeneryss
request
He
confesses
to
providing
the
spider
the
information
on
Daeneryss
activities
in
Essos
Ser
Jorah
leaves
Meereen
Daenerys
gets
angry
when
Jorah
also
admits
that
he
provided
the
information
of
her
pregnancy
with
Drogos
child
as
it
led
to
her
nearly
getting
poisoned
by
the
wine
merchant
outside
of
VaesDothrak
Jorah
defensively
tells
her
that
if
it
hadnt
been
for
him
she
would
have
been
poisoned
but
she
counters
that
was
only
because
he
saw
it
coming
Jorah
calls
her
name
and
begs
for
her
forgiveness
but
she
rejects
saying
that
he
sold
all
her
secrets
to
Robert
the
man
whom
she
finds
guilty
of
her
familys
murder
Jorah
is
forced
to
leave
the
city
within
the
day
or
have
his
head
thrown
into
the
Slavers
Bay
Jorah
then
leaves
Meereen
Season
Ser
Jorah
kidnaps
Tyrion
intending
to
take
him
to
Daenerys
Jorah
resurfaces
in
Volantis
drinking
in
a
brothel
and
shamefully
eyeing
a
whore
dressed
as
Daenerys
From
afar
he
recognizes
Tyrion
Lannister
and
Varys
Jorah
later
approaches
Tyrion
while
he
is
urinating
alone
and
binds
him
with
rope
and
gags
him
telling
Tyrion
that
he
is
taking
him
to
the
Queen
With
Tyrion
captive
Jorah
steals
a
small
boat
and
begins
to
sail
east
towards
Meereen
En
route
Tyrion
pesters
Jorah
with
muffled
whining
until
he
relents
and
removes
Tyrions
gag
Tyrion
notices
that
they
are
traveling
east
and
not
west
towards
Cersei
in
Kings
Landing
Jorah
reveals
that
he
is
taking
Tyrion
to
the
queen
he
serves
Daenerys
Targaryen
Tyrion
is
pleasantly
surprised
and
tries
to
convince
him
that
they
are
on
the
same
side
since
he
was
traveling
to
meet
Daenerys
anyway
He
also
accurately
deduces
who
Jorah
is
by
his
appearance
and
equipment
He
also
correctly
assumes
that
Jorah
must
have
been
banished
by
Daenerys
because
she
discovered
that
he
was
spying
on
her
for
Varys
Tyrion
mockingly
asks
Jorah
if
he
really
believes
that
he
will
earn
a
pardon
for
simply
delivering
him
to
Daenerys
alternately
she
might
pardon
Tyrion
and
behead
Jorah
instead
Fed
up
with
his
captive
Jorah
knocks
Tyrion
across
the
face
leaving
him
unconscious
Ser
Jorah
notices
that
his
wrist
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
As
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
their
journey
Tyrion
continues
to
mock
House
Mormont
as
well
as
Bear
Island
Eventually
the
two
find
Old
Valyria
and
passes
through
its
ruins
to
find
Meereen
While
sailing
through
the
ruins
the
two
look
in
astonishment
as
they
see
Drogon
fly
past
them
In
a
quick
turn
of
events
men
infected
with
Greyscale
appear
and
attack
the
two
Jorah
manages
to
fight
them
off
but
Tyrion
is
pulled
underwater
When
Tyrion
wakes
up
he
finds
himself
on
shore
saved
by
Jorah
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
but
Jorah
looks
at
his
wrists
and
notices
he
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
towards
Meereen
on
foot
having
failed
to
acquire
a
boat
During
conversation
Tyrion
mentions
to
Jorah
that
he
knew
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
from
his
trip
to
the
Wall
and
reveals
that
he
was
killed
by
his
own
men
in
a
mutiny
while
returning
from
a
great
ranging
leaving
Jorah
visibly
saddened
at
his
fathers
death
Jorah
is
also
pressed
by
Tyrion
for
information
as
to
why
he
is
serving
Daenerys
in
the
first
place
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
captured
by
slavers
Jorah
tells
him
that
he
grew
to
truly
believe
in
her
when
he
saw
her
emerge
from
Khal
Drogos
funeral
pyre
unscathed
with
three
dragon
hatchlings
and
that
she
also
has
a
birthright
to
the
throne
even
though
Tyrion
mentions
the
infamous
Targaryen
madness
that
may
surface
in
her
later
in
life
However
they
are
found
and
captured
by
slavers
The
leader
Malko
plans
to
sell
them
in
Volantis
but
Tyrion
convinces
them
to
allow
Jorah
to
participate
in
the
fighting
pits
in
Meereen
to
make
them
rich
offering
the
information
that
Jorah
once
unseated
Jaime
Lannister
in
a
jousting
match
When
Malko
scoffs
this
Jorah
brings
up
that
he
slew
Qotho
in
single
combat
inciting
Malkos
interest
and
convincing
him
to
take
them
to
Meereen
On
the
outskirts
of
Meereen
Jorah
is
put
on
auction
by
Malko
who
exaggerates
Jorahs
accomplishments
by
claiming
that
along
with
fighting
alongside
The
Stag
King
he
took
part
in
the
attack
on
Spike
with
his
flaming
sword
when
it
was
really
Thoros
of
Myr
singlehandedly
killed
Khal
Drogo
and
was
betrayed
by
his
wife
and
willingly
sold
into
slavery
in
order
to
repay
his
debts
A
slaver
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
buys
Jorah
and
Tyrion
as
well
when
Tyrion
convinces
him
They
are
taken
to
one
of
the
fighting
pits
and
when
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
present
for
the
opening
of
the
games
he
takes
a
sword
and
enters
the
arena
knocking
out
the
other
fighters
while
disguised
with
a
helmet
Jorah
approaches
Daenerys
and
removes
his
helmet
to
reveal
his
identity
but
Daenerys
who
still
hasnt
forgiven
him
orders
Jorah
to
be
taken
away
Jorah
informs
her
that
he
has
brought
a
gift
and
Tyrion
reveals
himself
meeting
Daenerys
facetoface
at
last
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
brought
before
Daenerys
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Back
in
Meereen
Daenerys
after
learning
Tyrion
wants
to
advise
her
asks
him
what
he
thinks
she
should
do
with
Jorah
Tyrion
tells
her
how
devoted
Jorah
seemed
to
be
to
her
and
that
he
did
not
think
she
would
be
wise
enough
to
forgive
him
He
then
tells
her
how
killing
people
devoted
to
her
is
not
a
ruler
who
inspires
devotion
and
that
she
would
need
lots
of
it
if
she
was
ever
going
to
rule
Westeros
but
when
she
did
he
couldnt
be
by
her
side
Daenerys
then
orders
Jorah
removed
from
the
city
once
more
Jorah
with
his
Greyscale
slowly
progressing
returns
to
the
fighting
pits
where
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
remains
Since
he
won
the
earlier
match
Jorah
demanded
that
he
fight
at
the
great
pit
in
front
of
the
queen
Jorah
says
he
is
the
best
he
has
and
that
if
he
wins
he
will
belong
to
Yezzan
Jorah
later
joins
the
Great
Games
in
Daznaks
Pit
in
front
of
the
queen
along
with
a
Water
Dancer
from
Braavos
a
Dothraki
warrior
a
Summer
Islander
with
a
halberd
a
Meereenese
champion
wielding
a
spear
and
another
fighter
When
Daenerys
recognizes
Jorah
she
is
visibly
distraught
and
as
the
fighting
continues
and
Jorah
is
severely
wounded
by
the
water
dancer
Tyrion
reminds
Daenerys
that
she
could
stop
the
fight
at
any
moment
to
save
Jorah
Ser
Jorah
fighting
in
the
Great
Pit
of
Daznak
Even
though
the
fear
is
clearly
shown
on
her
face
Daenerys
refuses
Jorah
manages
to
win
the
fight
despite
being
outmatched
during
most
of
it
Just
as
the
fight
ends
Jorah
throws
a
spear
towards
Daenerys
who
believing
the
spear
was
meant
for
her
ducks
out
of
the
way
The
spear
is
revealed
to
be
meant
for
a
Son
of
the
Harpy
who
was
sneaking
up
behind
her
Much
of
the
audience
reveals
themselves
to
be
Sons
of
the
Harpy
proceeding
to
kill
everyone
they
can
Jorah
joins
the
ensuing
battle
for
Daenerys
and
tries
to
help
escort
her
out
of
the
fighting
pit
but
they
eventually
end
up
surrounded
and
vastly
outnumbered
At
that
moment
Drogon
appears
in
the
arena
and
starts
killing
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
and
scaring
off
the
rest
Jorah
Tyrion
Daario
and
Missandei
all
observe
in
awe
as
Daenerys
flies
off
on
Drogon
Back
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Tyrion
addresses
both
Jorah
and
Daarios
feelings
for
Daenerys
understanding
how
one
could
love
the
wrong
woman
The
three
argue
about
Jorahs
betrayal
but
they
will
not
make
any
judgments
without
Daenerys
first
Jorah
Tyrion
and
Daario
plan
their
next
move
The
dragon
was
seen
taking
her
north
and
it
is
agreed
that
Jorah
will
join
Daario
to
ride
and
search
for
her
Grey
Worm
still
recovering
from
his
injuries
offers
to
go
with
them
as
does
Tyrion
Daario
firmly
nixes
both
ideas
Grey
Worm
is
needed
to
command
the
Unsullied
in
keeping
the
city
under
control
while
Tyrion
is
the
only
one
of
them
to
have
any
political
experience
Thus
Daario
and
Jorah
depart
together
hoping
to
find
their
Queen
in
the
Dothraki
Sea
Season
Jorah
and
Daario
search
for
Dany
Jorah
and
Daario
follow
Drogons
trail
into
the
Dothraki
sea
where
Daario
gets
him
to
admit
he
is
in
love
with
Daenerys
While
Daario
isnt
looking
Jorah
examines
the
spreading
greyscale
on
his
arm
to
determine
how
long
he
has
left
to
live
They
eventually
discover
a
circle
of
hoof
prints
where
Jorah
finds
Daeneryss
ring
in
the
middle
leading
them
to
realize
a
Dothraki
khalasar
has
taken
her
captive
Jorah
and
Daario
make
their
way
to
Vaes
Dothrak
with
Daario
taunting
Jorah
about
how
Daenerys
chose
him
as
her
lover
Jorah
scans
the
city
and
deduces
that
Daenerys
has
been
taken
to
the
temple
of
the
dosh
khaleen
Jorah
and
Daario
leave
their
weapons
outside
the
city
and
Daario
notices
Jorahs
greyscale
Jorah
assures
Daario
that
he
was
not
infected
The
two
sneak
into
the
city
at
night
and
are
caught
by
two
Dothraki
Jorah
tries
to
pass
off
himself
and
Daario
as
lost
merchants
but
the
Dothraki
see
through
the
ruse
After
killing
them
Jorah
and
Daario
find
Daenerys
and
offer
to
help
her
escape
the
city
but
she
enlists
them
in
her
plan
to
take
control
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Daario
kill
the
guards
outside
the
temple
in
which
the
khals
are
determining
Daeneryss
fate
and
bar
the
door
resulting
in
the
khals
being
unable
to
escape
when
Daenerys
sets
the
temple
ablaze
When
Daenerys
emerges
from
the
inferno
unburnt
Jorah
and
Daario
bow
before
her
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
shows
Daenerys
his
greyscale
sickness
The
next
day
overlooking
the
smoldering
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
Daenerys
confronts
Jorah
She
reminds
him
that
she
has
banished
him
twice
but
remembers
that
he
has
twice
returned
and
has
saved
her
life
As
she
ponders
what
to
do
Jorah
interjects
that
she
must
send
him
away
revealing
his
greyscale
He
explains
that
he
does
not
know
of
a
cure
or
how
long
the
disease
takes
but
that
he
will
end
things
before
he
becomes
a
stone
man
himself
Jorah
then
tells
Daenerys
that
Tyrion
Lannister
was
right
about
him
he
loves
her
and
will
always
love
her
and
begins
to
leave
Daenerys
stops
him
and
rather
than
dismissing
him
tearfully
orders
Jorah
to
go
and
find
a
cure
for
his
disease
so
that
he
may
be
by
her
side
when
she
takes
back
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Jorah
and
Dany
then
part
on
good
terms
as
he
watches
her
lead
her
new
khalasar
out
of
Vaes
Dothrak
before
embarking
on
his
own
new
quest
Season
Sam
performs
a
risky
treatment
on
Jorah
to
cure
him
of
his
greyscale
Jorah
has
traveled
to
Oldtown
seeking
a
cure
for
his
greyscale
but
has
been
placed
inside
one
of
the
sick
cells
in
the
Citadel
As
Samwell
Tarly
is
collecting
empty
bowls
from
cells
Jorah
reaches
out
for
him
his
infection
having
spread
rapidly
and
asks
if
Daenerys
has
reached
Westeros
yet
but
Sam
claims
he
does
not
know
Jorah
is
later
deemed
beyond
saving
by
Archmaester
Ebrose
and
is
told
that
he
has
one
more
day
before
he
will
be
deported
to
the
Valyrian
Peninsula
to
live
out
the
rest
of
his
days
with
the
stone
men
as
the
greyscale
will
take
over
his
mind
in
six
months
Within
that
time
he
still
seeks
to
end
his
own
life
before
then
He
properly
introduces
himself
to
Samwell
explaining
that
there
is
no
point
writing
to
Lyanna
Mormont
as
House
Mormont
forgot
about
him
a
long
time
ago
Jorah
returns
to
Dany
Later
that
night
as
Jorah
writes
a
farewell
note
to
Daenerys
he
is
visited
by
Sam
who
claims
that
out
of
respect
for
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
he
will
try
to
save
him
from
his
greyscale
though
he
admits
he
has
never
tried
before
and
is
the
only
one
who
will
despite
it
being
risky
for
both
Sam
and
Jorah
Aware
of
the
alternative
Jorah
consents
to
the
treatment
He
is
given
rum
as
anesthesia
and
a
mouthguard
to
bite
on
during
the
painful
procedure
to
stay
silent
Bearing
the
pain
Jorah
allows
Sam
to
start
peeling
his
infected
skin
away
With
his
greyscale
now
cured
by
Samwell
Ebrose
allows
the
release
of
Jorah
from
his
cell
When
Ebrose
asks
of
the
disease
Jorah
says
it
must
have
cured
itself
from
having
plenty
of
rest
Before
Jorah
leaves
he
tells
Sam
he
will
return
to
Daenerys
that
both
she
and
Sam
has
saved
his
life
Jorah
shakes
Sams
hand
in
gratitude
before
leaving
After
leaving
the
Citadel
Jorah
makes
his
way
to
Dragonstone
where
he
is
finally
reunited
with
Daenerys
who
gladly
accepts
him
back
into
her
service
and
calls
him
a
friend
He
also
meets
Jon
Snow
who
served
under
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
in
the
Nights
Watch
Jorah
later
attends
a
meeting
during
which
Tyrion
Lannister
suggests
that
they
should
capture
a
wight
and
bring
it
to
Cersei
Lannister
thus
proving
that
the
army
of
the
dead
is
marching
upon
Westeros
and
allowing
Daenerys
to
take
her
troops
to
help
Jon
Jorah
volunteers
to
join
the
mission
and
leaves
Dragonstone
with
Jon
Davos
Seaworth
and
Gendry
Upon
arriving
at
EastwatchbytheSea
Jorah
quickly
recognizes
the
imprisoned
Thoros
of
Myr
having
fought
together
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
Unfortunately
the
mention
of
Jorahs
family
name
creates
friction
with
Tormund
due
to
Jeor
Mormonts
role
in
persecuting
the
wildlings
Nevertheless
Jorah
accompanies
the
party
north
of
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Jon
to
keep
Longclaw
Once
beyond
the
Wall
Jorah
discusses
his
fathers
death
with
Jon
Snow
stating
that
being
killed
by
his
own
men
was
the
worst
way
for
Jeor
to
pass
away
They
also
discuss
the
fact
that
Ned
Stark
wanted
to
execute
Jorah
and
Jon
offers
to
give
Longclaw
back
to
House
Mormont
However
Jorah
refuses
as
he
brought
shame
on
his
family
he
has
no
longer
the
right
to
wield
the
weapon
which
must
remain
with
Jon
as
Jeor
wanted
Later
the
party
is
attacked
by
an
undead
bear
which
severely
injures
Thoros
before
Jorah
kills
the
beast
with
a
final
strike
Jorah
and
Thoros
then
discuss
the
Siege
of
Pyke
with
Thoros
acknowledging
that
he
was
so
drunk
that
day
that
he
completely
forgot
the
battle
Jorah
assists
in
subduing
a
wight
The
party
finally
encounters
a
small
group
of
wights
led
by
a
White
Walker
They
attack
it
and
Jorah
is
assaulted
by
a
wight
who
tries
to
choke
him
to
death
before
being
shattered
when
Jon
kills
the
White
Walker
leading
them
They
successfully
capture
an
undead
but
it
draw
the
attention
of
the
whole
undead
army
which
rushed
at
them
While
Gendry
returns
to
Eastwatch
to
send
a
raven
to
Daenerys
Jorah
and
the
others
find
refuge
on
a
small
island
in
the
middle
of
the
frozen
lake
that
the
wights
cannot
cross
They
spend
the
night
on
the
rocks
to
which
Thoros
does
not
survive
and
are
later
attacked
by
the
army
of
the
Night
King
as
the
ice
layer
over
the
water
is
solid
enough
Jorah
fights
along
the
others
with
a
pair
of
dragonglass
daggers
destroying
many
wights
but
the
party
is
easily
outnumbered
and
only
survives
thanks
to
the
arrival
of
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
Jorah
is
shocked
and
saddened
when
he
witnesses
the
death
of
Daenerys
youngest
dragon
Viserion
at
the
hands
of
the
Night
King
The
survivors
manage
to
escape
except
Jon
Snow
who
is
taken
beneath
the

Back
to
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Daenerys
that
they
should
return
to
Kings
Landing
and
attends
Jons
return
to
Eastwatch
after
he
was
saved
by
Benjen
Stark
Jorah
during
the
negotiation
in
the
Dragonpit
Jorah
goes
to
Kings
Landing
to
attend
the
negotiation
between
Daenerys
Cersei
and
Jon
explaining
the
origins
of
the
Dragonpit
to
Missandei
on
the
way
They
are
greeted
by
Bronn
who
escorts
them
to
their
seats
with
Jorah
sitting
right
next
to
Daenerys
Jorah
does
not
speak
during
the
discussions
Like
everyone
else
he
is
surprised
when
Jon
openly
pledges
allegiance
to
Daenerys
and
stays
at
the
Dragonpit
while
Tyrion
tries
to
convince
Cersei
to
help
them
after
she
left
the
negotiation
After
Cersei
seemingly
agrees
to
send
troops
to
fight
the
army
of
the
Night
King
Jorah
leaves
Kings
Landing
with
the
others
and
make
his
way
to
the
North
Personality
Jorah
is
a
complex
character
as
he
isDaenerys
Targaryens
most
loyal
advisor
and
a
formidable
warrior
Jorah
has
a
deep
respect
loyalty
and
love
for
Daenerys
and
has
always
tried
to
give
her
reasonable
practical
and
effective
advice
While
Jorah
is
a
moral
person
and
always
tries
to
be
honorable
he
has
done
several
dishonorable
acts
out
of
love
or
for
his
own
survival
He
sold
poachers
into
slavery
to
pay
for
his
wifes
spending
habits
fled
Westeros
to
escape
executionand
briefly
spied
on
Daenerys
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
royal
pardon
though
he
stopped
spying
on
her
after
becoming
her
advisor
Jorah
is
Daeneryss
most
levelheaded
advisor
at
least
until
the
arrival
of
Barristan
Selmy
Jorah
is
intelligent
literate
and
well
travelled
knowing
the
histories
of
Essos
and
speaking
several
tongues
including
Dothraki
His
relationship
with
his
father
and
likely
the
rest
of
his
family
wasnt
approached
until
the
fifth
season
Although
he
never
showed
any
feelings
towards
Jeor
once
he
was
given
the
news
about
his
death
Jorah
was
visibly
shaken
and
deeply
upset
even
angrily
demanding
to
know
the
details
of
his
fathers
death
This
is
most
likely
because
he
was
still
feeling
guilty
about
bringing
his
family
shame
and
never
fully
reconciling
with
Jeor
Although
stoic
shortspoken
and
sometimes
cold
Jorah
does
have
the
ability
to
warm
up
to
people
once
they
earn
his
respect
At
first
he
treated
Tyrion
like
a
hostage
but
later
after
the
two
barely
survived
the
sinking
of
their
boat
he
started
to
trust
Tyrion
enough
to
leave
him
untied
and
later
the
two
men
shared
their
life
stories
and
freely
discussed
Daenerys
and
her
claim
to
the
throne
although
their
newfound
trust
was
shattered
when
Tyrion
convinced
Daenerys
to
exile
Jorah
from
Meereen
again
which
he
did
to
spare
him
Daeneryss
wrath
He
is
also
a
skilled
warrior
though
he
does
have
a
honor
code
and
tries
not
to
kill
his
opponent
if
such
option
is
possible
This
is
shown
in
the
fighting
pit
where
every
other
warrior
was
brutally
slaughtering
one
another
but
Jorah
came
victorious
without
any
loss
of
life
in
his
hands
This
worked
in
his
favor
since
he
was
aware
that
Daenerys
was
becoming
increasingly
appalled
by
the
needless
violence
happening
in
the
pit
right
before
Jorah
got
into
the
skirmish
And
even
after
using
brute
force
to
harm
another
person
he
does
seem
to
try
compensate
for
his
actions
as
he
did
give
some
money
to
a
knocked
out
fisherman
for
his
stolen
boat
Also
Jorah
has
an
immense
tolerance
for
pain
as
he
managed
to
stay
silent
during
Sams
procedure
to
cure
him
of
the
greyscale
even
though
the
Citadel
apprentice
was
effectively
cutting
bits
of
Jorahs
own
skin

thoughts
on
Jorah
while
conversing
with
Daenerys
Targaryensrc
Behind
the
scenes
On
the
Season
Bluray
Jorah
narrates
a
Histories
Lore
video
on
The
Free
Cities
On
the
Season
Bluray
he
narrates
Slavers
Bay
and
The
Unsullied
and
on
Season
Bluray
he
narrates
Valyrian
Steel
in
which
he
also
mentions
his
own
past
and
family
He
also
narrates
Vaes
Dothrak
and
The
Dothraki
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Jorah
is
described
as
balding
and
hairy
but
still
fit
though
not
a
handsome
man
He
is
the
son
of
Lord
Jeor
Mormont
of
Bear
Island
He
won
honor
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
when
he
was
one
of
the
first
through
the
breach
during
the
storming
of
Pyke
For
his
valor
he
won
praise
from
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
a
knighthood
With
a
strong
vigorous
son
ready
to
take
over
the
lordship
Jeor
decided
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
where
he
rapidly
rose
to
the
rank
of
Lord
Commander
leaving
Jorah
as
Lord
of
Bear
Island
Jorahs
first
wife
was
an
unnamed
woman
of
House
Glover
who
was
unable
to
carry
a
child
to
term
in
ten
years
of
marriage
and
died
after
a
third
miscarriage
She
has
not
been
referred
to
in
the
TV
series
He
later
married
Lynesse
Hightower
of
the
extremely
powerful
House
Hightower
of
Oldtown
after
winning
a
tournament
to
celebrate
the
victory
of
King
Robert
against
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
in
which
Jorah
wore
Lynesses
favor
Lynesse
was
used
to
the
riches
and
luxury
of
the
secondlargest
city
in
Westeros
and
found
Bear
Island
primitive
and
crude
Jorahs
attempts
to
please
his
wife
led
to
him
spending
all
of
his
money
He
disgraced
himself
through
behavior
unbefitting
a
lord
by
arresting
poachers
and
selling
them
to
slavers
Slavery
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
has
been
for
millennia
When
Eddard
Stark
came
to
arrest
Jorah
he
and
Lynesse
fled
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
the
Free
City
of
Lys
leaving
his
aunt
Maege
to
become
the
ruling
Lady
of
Bear
Island
Jorah
attempted
to
make
his
living
as
a
sellsword
but
was
unable
to
provide
an
income
acceptable
to
Lynesse
She
left
him
and
became
a
concubine
to
the
merchant
lord
Tregar
Ormollen
who
then
exiled
Jorah
from
the
city
Daenerys
learns
of
Jorahs
past
spying
for
Varys
earlier
in
the
book
narrative
before
she
conquers
Meereen
Ser
Barristan
initially
conceals
his
true
identity
from
her
claiming
to
be
a
squire
named
Arstan
Whitebeard
this
storyline
was
omitted
from
the
TV
series
and
when
he
finally
reveals
himself
he
also
tells
her
of
Jorahs
treachery
which
Barristan
knew
from
attending
Roberts
small
council
meetings
in
the
series
Barristan
was
not
a
member
of
the
small
council
and
thus
he
knew
nothing
of
Jorahs
spying
She
initially
dismisses
both
and
assigns
them
a
suicide
mission
to
conquer
Meereen
by
entering
the
city
via
its
sewers
To
her
surprise
and
disappointment
both
survive
the
mission
and
help
her
capture
the
city
She
forgives
Ser
Barristan
and
readmits
him
into
her
service
She
intends
to
pardon
Jorah
too
but
is
angered
by
his
attitude
he
remains
defensive
and
lacks
contrition
when
she
thinks
he
ought
to
be
begging
for
her
forgiveness
so
she
dismisses
him
although
she
fights
back
tears
as
she
does
so
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
if
she
sees
him
again
she
will
order
Strong
Belwas
who
does
not
appear
in
the
TV
series
to
wrench
his
head
off
Daario
Naharis
offers
to
kill
Jorah
for
her
but
Daenerys
decides
to
spare
him
and
he
is
allowed
to
leave
the
city
Daario
warns
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
kill
Jorah
or
otherwise
keep
him
close
There
is
no
mentioning
in
the
books
that
Jorah
ever
served
in
the
Golden
Company
though
it
is
said
that
after
Lynesse
left
him
he
scraped
by
as
a
sellsword
for
years
until
he
came
to
Pentos
to
spy
on
the
Targaryens
At
first
he
fought
as
a
sellsword
for
Lys
but
after
Lynesses
new
lover
exiled
him
from
the
city
he
drifted
to
Volantis
where
he
spent
the
better
part
of
a
year
working
as
a
sellsword
and
owning
nothing
but
his
sword
Jorah
is
never
attacked
by
Stone
Men
or
infected
with
Greyscale
Instead
Tyrion
was
attacked
by
Stone
Men
earlier
in
his
journeyin
the
ruins
of
Chroyane
instead
of
Valyria
It
is
a
man
named
Griff
one
of
Tyrions
companions
at
the
time
who
gets
infected
with
Greyscale
instead
Jorah
Tyrion
and
their
dwarf
companion
board
a
ship
at
Volantis
heading
for
Qarth
The
ship
is
badly
damaged
in
a
storm
After
drifting
for
at
least
nineteen
days
slavers
from
Yunkai
appear
Tyrion
and
all
the
rest
of
the
passangers
yield
without
fight
but
Jorah
resists
fiercely
and
kills
three
of
the
slavers
before
he
is
overcome
As
a
result
the
slavers
treat
him
much
more
harshly
than
their
other
captives
he
has
been
chained
to
an
oar
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
starved
and
branded
with
a
tattoo
of
demons
mask
on
one
cheek
His
face
has
been
so
bruised
and
swollen
that
he
is
almost
unrecognizable
Although
Jorah
has
treated
Tyrion
very
brutally
Tyrion
takes
no
pleasure
from
Jorahs
miseries
The
slavers
who
capture
Jorah
and
Tyrion
have
no
idea
who
Jorah
is
He
is
introduced
by
the
auctioneer
simply
as
big
and
strong
man
He
is
nearly
bought
by
Zahrina
for
the
fighting
pits
but
Tyrion
intervenes
and
persuades
the
overseer
of
Yezzans
slaves
to
buy
Jorah
too
claiming
that
he
takes
part
in
the
show
that
Tyrion
and
his
other
companion
play
for
entertainment
Jorah
does
not
try
to
escape
or
resist
his
captors
he
simply
ignores
their
commands
with
muttered
curses
so
he
is
locked
in
a
cage
and
beaten
severely
every
evening
to
the
point
that
he
hardly
looks
human
He
is
kept
naked
except
for
a
breechclout
a
filthy
bit
of
yellow
rag
He
never
gets
to
see
Daenerys
let
alone
speak
with
her
and
she
has
no
idea
he
is
nearby
Following
Daeneryss
departure
from
Meereen
Tyrion
and
Jorah
escape
from
Yezzan
to
the
camp
of
the
Second
Sons
who
betrayed
Daenerys
and

Daenerys
of

In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Daena
was
the
bride
of
her
brother
King
Baelor
Targaryen
He
had
taken
her
as
his
wife
at
the
insistence
of
his
father
Aegon
III
However
the
two
never
consummated
their
marriage
Instead
Baelor
had
dissolved
his
marriage
to
Daena
and
then
along
with
her
sisters
Rhaena
and
Elaena
locked
her
inside
a
section
of
the
Red
Keep
that
would
become
known
as
the
Maidenvault
so
they
wouldnt
incite
him
or
others
in
the
court
to
lust
During
this
time
she
escaped
her
confinement
several
times
and
had
an
affair
with
her
first
cousin
Aegon
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
married
to
his
sister
Naerys
When
she
became
pregnant
she
refused
to
name
the
father
and
became
known
as
Daena
the
Defiant
She
named
her
son
Daemon
and
raised
him
alone
The
royal
succession
laws
were
changed
after
the
disastrous
civil
war
between
Rhaenyra
Targaryen
Aegon
IIIs
mother
and
Rhaenyras
halfbrother
Aegon
II
While
under
normal
Andal
inheritance
law
a
lords
daughter
would
inherit
his
lands
and
titles
if
he
had
no
surviving
sons
the
new
laws
wanted
to
ensure
that
another
royal
succession
war
such
as
the
one
surrounding
Rhaenyra
would
never
occur
again
Therefore
the
new
succession
laws
enacted
during
the
reign
of
Daenas
own
father
put
female
heirs
behind
all
possible
male
heirs
Under
normal
Andal
inheritance
laws
with
both
of
Aegon
IIIs
sons
dead
the
throne
should
have
passed
to
Daena
as
his
eldest
surviving
daughter
Under
the
new
inheritance
laws
however
the
throne
had
to
pass
to
Aegon
IIIs
nearest
surviving
male
heir
his
younger
brother
Viserys
II
uncle
of
Daena
and
father
of
her
lover
Aegon
Daenas
cousin
Aegon
later
succeeded
his
father
as
King
Aegon
IV
On
his
deathbed
Aegon
IV
legitimized
all
of
his
bastard
children
including
acknowledging
that
Daemon
was
in
fact
his
own
son
He
even
gave
Daemon
the
ancestral
Valyrian
steel
sword
of
House
Targaryen
Blackfyre
which
had
been
wielded
by
Aegon
the
Conqueror
himself
After
being
legitimized
he
took
the
formal
name
Daemon
Blackfyre
and
founded
the
Cadet
branch
of
House
Targaryen
known
as
House
Blackfyre
Aegon
IVs
trueborn
son
succeeded
to
the
throne
as
King
Daeron
II
Targaryen
Over
the
next
six
generations
House
Blackfyre
would
launch
repeated
attempts
to
seize
the
throne
from
the
main
branch
of
the
Targaryen
family
As
a
result
all
subsequent
generations
of
House
Blackfyre
descended
from
Daena
and
Aegon
III
as
well
as
Aegon
IV
albeit
as
legitimized
bastards
Some
even
pointed
out
that
had
the
succession
laws
not
changed
Daena
would
have
inherited
the
throne
ahead
of
her
uncle
Viserys
II
Meanwhile
subsequent
generations
of
the
main
Targaryen
family
descend
from
Aegon
IV
and
Viserys
II
but
not
from
Viserys
IIs
older
brother
Aegon
III
The
Blackfyres
and
their
supporters
felt
this
gave
them
a
superior
claim
to
the
throne
while
the
main
Targaryen
family
Daeron
II
and
his
descendants
held
that
it
did
not
due
to
Daemons
status
as
a
legitimized
bastard

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
is
a
formerly
exiled
Northern
lord
from
Westeros
previously
living
in
Essos
He
has
sworn
fealty
to
his
fellow
exile
Daenerys
Targaryen
and
was
the
first
to
help
her
adapt
to
life
as
a
Khaleesi
of
the
Dothraki
Originally
Jorah
was
working
as
a
spy
for
Varys
King
Roberts
spymaster
in
Kings
Landing
sending
Varys
information
about
the
Targaryen
exiles
But
he
grows
to
respect
and
admire
Daenerys
and
begins
serving
her
in
earnest
He
saves
her
from
an
assassination
attempt
stops
sending
reports
to
Varys
and
ignores
an
official
royal
pardon
that
would
allow
him
to
return
home
to
Westeros
He
develops
strong
and
unrequited
feelings
for
her
When
Daenerys
learns
of
his
past
spying
he
is
dismissed
from
her
service
and
ordered
to
leave
her
presence
He
later
capturesTyrion
Lannisterin
the
hope
of
winning
his
way
back
to
her
an
endeavor
that
leads
to
him
contracting
the
deadly
greyscale
After
he
helps
save
her
life
from
both
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
and
the
Dothraki
Daenerys
accepts
him
back
to
her
service
and
orders
him
to
come
back
to
her
after
he
finds
a
cure
to
his
disease
which
he
eventually

caught
and
disgraced
He
was
stripped
of
his
Lordship
and
fled
to
the
Free
Cities
to
avoid
being
executed
by
Eddard
Stark
though
he
left
his
familys
ancestral
sword
Longclaw
behind
his
father
would
eventually
pass
it
on
to
Jon
Snow
He
served
in
mercenary
companies
such
as
the
Golden
Company
His
wife
eventually
left
him
for
another
richer
man
He
is
called
Jorah
the
Andal
by
the
Dothraki
as
they
assume
that
all
people
from
Westeros
are
Andals
However
Jorah
is
actually
a
Northman
descended
from
the
First
Men
Besides
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros
Ser
Jorah
is
fluent
in
the
Dothraki
language
Season
Daenerys
and
Jorah
Mormont
in
the
Dothraki
sea
Jorah
appears
at
the
wedding
of
Khal
Drogo
and
Daenerys
Targaryen
He
introduces
himself
and
presents
Daenerys
with
some
books
containing
songs
and
stories
from
Westeros
He
tells
her
that
he
served
her
father
for
many
years
and
pledges
to
serve
the
rightful
king
her
brother
Viserys
While
traveling
to
Vaes
Dothrak
Ser
Jorah
tells
Viserys
that
he
lost
his
home
because
he
sold
some
poachers
to
slavers
which
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Eddard
Stark
wanted
to
execute
him
for
breaking
the
law
He
fled
instead
Viserys
dismisses
the
charges
as
foolishness
saying
such
things
will
be
tolerated
under
his
rule
Mormont
is
less
certain
that
this
will
happen
Ser
Jorah
is
impressed
by
Daeneryss
growing
ability
to
command
When
Viserys
tries
to
hit
Daenerys
she
is
defended
by
her
bodyguard
Rakharo
who
asks
her
if
she
wants
Viserys
killed
She
commands
that
no
harm
come
to
him
Viserys
orders
Ser
Jorah
to
kill
Daenerys
men
a
suicidal
order
that
Jorah
pointedly
ignores
from
this
point
on
he
is
under
Daeneryss
command
Rakharo
orders
Viseryss
horse
taken
so
he
has
to
walk
a
disgrace
for
a
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Rakharo
debate
combat
techniques
Jorah
talks
to
Rakharo
and
helps
him
learn
some
Westerosi
words
to
better
serve
her
Jorah
and
Rakharo
also
swap
their
opinions
on
the
value
of
swords
and
armors
versus
the
arakh
and
some
personal
information
Jorah
states
that
his
father
is
a
man
of
great
honor
and
integrity
and
that
Jorahs
disgrace
betrayed
him
When
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
he
rides
to
the
nearby
Free
City
of
Qohor
It
is
later
revealed
that
he
sent
information
to
Varys
in
Kings
Landing
about
Daeneryss
pregnancy
Arriving
at
Vaes
Dothrak
Daenerys
asks
Jorah
if
he
thinks
the
Dothraki
could
retake
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
her
House
Mormont
points
out
the
difficulties
of
persuading
them
to
cross
the
Narrow
Sea
but
believes
success
would
be
possible
if
that
could
be
accomplished
and
if
King
Robert
was
foolish
enough
to
meet
them
in
open
battle
He
says
that
if
their
opponents
retreated
behind
stone
walls
the
Dothraki
would
not
be
able
to
root
them
out
They
move
to
discussing
Jorahs
background
and
he
admits
to
selling
the
poachers
as
slaves
to
raise
money
for
his
expensive
wife
When
Daenerys
asks
him
where
his
wife
is
Jorah
replies
that
she
is
with
another
man
in
another
place
Jorah
warning
Viserys
In
Kings
Landing
Eddard
Stark
learns
that
Jorah
Mormont
is
Varyss
agent
and
spy
in
Daeneryss
retinue
He
puts
little
faith
in
Jorahs
information
that
Daenerys
is
pregnant
considering
him
a
traitor
who
will
say
anything
for
a
royal
pardon
However
King
Robert
and
his
council
are
adamant
that
his
information
can
be
relied
on
and
order
the
assassination
of
Daenerys
Jorah
translates
for
the
benefit
of
Viserys
during
the
ceremony
where
Daenerys
eats
a
stallions
heart
so
that
the
Dosh
khaleen
can
prophesize
about
her
baby
Viserys
thinks
it
is
disgusting
but
when
he
realizes
that
the
Dothraki
love
Daenerys
he
slips
away
Jorah
follows
and
finds
him
trying
to
steal
Daeneryss
three
dragon
eggs
He
is
tired
of
waiting
and
he
wants
to
sell
the
eggs
to
buy
an
army
Viserys
accuses
Jorah
of
having
desires
for
his
sister
but
Jorah
still
stops
him
from
leaving
using
a
variation
of
the
motto
of
his
house
Yet
here
I
stand
Viserys
backs
down
and
leaves
without
the
eggs
Later
when
Viserys
threatens
Daenerys
Jorah
tries
to
stop
him
as
drawing
blood
in
the
sacred
city
is
punishable
by
death
When
Drogo
executes
Viserys
with
a
pot
of
molten
gold
he
urges
Daenerys
to
look
away
but
she
refuses

Jorah
accompanies

her
handmaidens
to
the
market
He
receives
a
message
from
a
lad
one
of
Varyss
informers
that
he
calls
his
Little
Birds
who
says
the
Spider
sends
his
regards
and
hands
him
a
parchment
which
he
says
is
his
pardon
and
he
can
go
home
now
Ser
Jorah
clutches
it
and
looks
at
it
with
longing
but
realizes
it
means
that
if
they
dont
need
anyone
to
spy
on
Daenerys
anymore
she
is
likely
in
danger
He
goes
back
to
the
market
and
seeing
a
wineseller
trying
to
give
Daenerys
a
cask
as
a
gift
he
intervenes
and
prevents
the
assassination
as
the
wine
is
poisoned
Drogo

his

if

Daenerys
is
shocked
to
learn
that
her

son
will
be
killed
in
the
resulting

to
succeed
Drogo
Jorah
suggests
they
leave
quietly
and
try
to
get
to
Asshai
where
there
is
a
port
but
Daenerys
refuses
She
begs
the
Lhazareen
witch
Mirri
Maz
Duur
to
help
Drogo
with
blood
magic
and
tells
Ser
Jorah
that
he
should
put
on
his
armor
When
Drogos
bloodrider
Qotho
tries
to
halt
the
ceremony
Ser
Jorah
stops
him
with
his
sword
They
fight
and
the
younger

swiftly
gains
the
upper
hand
through

his
arakh
is
unable
to
penetrate
Jorahs
heavy
armor
allowing
Jorah
to
kill
him
Daenerys
goes
into

are
too
afraid
to

cursed
because

the
maegi
Jorah
takes
her
into

to
seek

is
with

she
insists
on

and
her
child
She
learns
that
her
son
was
stillborn
badly
malformed
and
that
Drogo
is
alive

comatose
while
the

has
scattered

dragon
eggs
placed
on
the
pyre
and
has
Jorah
bind
Duur
to
the
pyre
so
that
she
may
burn
alive
Ser
Jorah
tries
to
stop
Daenerys
from
burning
the
dragon
eggs
as
they
can
be
sold
to
buy
her
a
life
of
travel
to
exotic
places
He
tells
her
he
knows
she
is
planning
on
stepping
onto
the
pyre
as
well
and
says
she
must
not
She
strokes
his
cheek
and
gives
a
speech
to
her
people
saying
that
they
may
go
but
if
they
stay
she
will
lead
them
to
a

she
wonders
where

what
can
she
do
against
starvation
Jorah
reminds
her
that
returning
either
to
Lhazar
or
to
the
Dothraki

would
mean
their
death
and
the
loss
of
her
dragons
at

He

He
is
also
with

when
Kraznys
mo
Nakloz
demonstrates
the
level
of
obedience
of
his
Unsullied
soldiers
by
slicing
off
one
of
their
nipples
and
urges
her
to
purchase
them
During
the
conversation
Daenerys
finds
herself
distracted
by
a
young
girl
playing
with
a
ball
A
cloaked
stranger
appears
from
behind
them
to
knock
the
ball
out
of
her
hands
and
Jorah
engages
in
a
struggle
with
him
The
ball
hits
the
floor
and
cracks
open
to
reveal
a
manticore
which
the
stranger
promptly
stabs
with
his
dagger
When
he
removes
his
hood

merits
of
buying
the
Unsullied
Barristan
advises
Daenerys
that
there
is
no
honor
in
conquering
with
a
purchased
slave
army
Jorah
counters
that
honor
does
not
win
battles
and
that
the
Unsullied
are
not
like
a
regular
army
They
will
not
rape
and
pillage
and
will
only
kill
who
they
are
ordered
to
kill
Daenerys
eventually
offers
one
of
her
dragons
to
Kraznys
in
return
for
all
of
his
Unsullied
a
deal
that
Jorah
and
Barristan
both
strongly
advise
her
against
Nevertheless
Daenerys
stands
her
ground
and
scolds
her
two
advisors
for
contradicting
her
in
public
Jorah
is
present
at
the
Sack
of
Astapor
where
Daenerys
manages
to
both
keep
all
of
her
dragons
and
win
the
army
as
well
as
their
trust
in
her
as
a
queen
and
not
as
a
mistress
effectively
getting
the
best
out
of
both
Jorah
and
Barristans
prior
arguments
On
the
road
north
to
Yunkai
Jorah
reminisces
with

about
the
day
he
was
knighted
by
King
Robert
for
his
part
in
the
Siege
of
Pyke
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
He
recalls
that
the
only
thing
on
his
mind
was
how
badly
he
needed
to
urinate
having
been
sealed
in
armor
for
sixteen
hours
Barristan
prods
Jorah
about
his
past
when
he
was
disgraced
and
exiled
for
his
involvement
in
the
slave
trade
and
warns
him
that
his
presence
alongside
Daenerys
may
harm
her
image
in
Westeros
Jorah
questions
Barristan
about
the
advisors
on
King
Roberts
Small
Council
subtly
trying
to
ascertain
whether
Barristan
knows
that
he
was
previously
spying
on
Daenerys
for
Varys
However
Barristan
explains
that
as
a
former
Targaryen
loyalist
King
Robert
did
not
fully
trust
him
and
excluded
him
from
council
meetings
Jorah
and
Barristan
briefly
bicker
about
the
fact
that
Barristan
has
only
just
arrived
while
Jorah
has
been
protecting
Daenerys
for
months
Jorah
tells
Barristan
that
he
is
not
Lord
Commander
here
and
he
only
takes
orders
from
Daenerys
Upon
arriving
at
Yunkais
gates
Jorah
is
dismissive
of
Daeneryss
and
Barristans
claims
that
its
reputation
for
training
bed
slaves
rather
than
soldiers
will
give
them
a
clear
advantage
and
explains
that
Yunkai
will
in
all
likelihood
just
shut
its
gates
and
chip
away
at
Daeneryss
army
using
guerilla
tactics
He
also
advises
Dany
that
conquering
Yunkai
is
irrelevant
in
their
quest
to
return
to
Westeros
but
she
is
adamant
on
freeing
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
slaves
within
the
city
walls
Jorah
is
present
in
Daeneryss
tent
when
the
Yunkish
slavetrader
Razdal
mo
Eraz
arrives
bearing
gifts
Following
her
orders
he
spies
on
the
mercenary
group
the
Second
Sons
and
is
again
present
in
her
tent
when
she
is
hosting
the
two
mercenary
captains
Mero
and
Prendahl
na
Ghezn
and
their
lieutenant
Daario
Naharis
Mero
is
sexually
vulgar
towards
Daenerys
which
prompts
Ser
Jorah
to
threaten
him
to
mind
his
tongue
With
Daarios
help
Jorah
and
Grey
Worm
enter
Yunkai
from
one
of
its
posterior
tunnels
and
the
three
of
them
successfully
fight
off
a
number
of
guards
and
open
the
gates
of
Yunkai
from
the
inside
allowing
the
Unsullied
to
sweep
in
and
win
the
city
for
Daenerys
Jorah
however
is
noticably
distraught
when
all
of
Daeneryss
postvictory
attention
is
centered
on
Daario
Jorah
along
with
Ser
Barristan
Daario
and
Missandei
is
also
present
when
Daenerys
is
greeted
with
open
arms
by
the
newly
freed
slaves
of
Yunkai
Season
While
feeding
her
dragons
Dany
is
warned
by
Jorah
once
again
about
the
fact
that
they
are
not
tameable
beasts
He
also
informs
her
that
Daario
Naharis
and
Grey
Worm
are
gambling
When
the
army
of
Unsullied
halts
in
unison
Jorah
faces
the
crucifixion
of
a
small
child
one
of
along
the
path
to
Meereen
greatest
of
the
cities
of
Slavers
Bay
As
the
one
who
has
been
at
her
side
the
longest
Ser
Jorah
volunteers
to
face
the
champion
sent
out
by
Meereen
when
Daenerys
arrives
at
their
gates
Daenerys
refuses
to
gamble
with
the
life
of
her
most
trusted
advisor
general
and
dearest
friend
Ser
Jorah
is
confronted
by
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
regarding
Mormonts
royal
pardon
Ser
Jorah
informs
Daenerys
that
King
Joffrey
Baratheon
has
been
poisoned
at
his
own
wedding
He
also
informs
her
of
the
disasters
in
the
two
cities
she
liberated
Yunkai
and
Astapor
Daeneryss
companions
debate
about
possibly
mounting
an
invasion
of
Westeros
due
to
its
current
state
Jorah
is
against
it
stating
that
their
forces
could
not
conquer
all
of
Westeros
alone
and
they
have
no
real
allies
on
the
continent
After
Daenerys
dismisses
the
rest
of
her
council
she
tells
Jorah
that
her
business
in
Slavers
Bay
is
not
yet
complete
and
intends
to
stay
Some
weeks
later
Jorah
enters
Daeneryss
chambers
early
in
the
morning
and
is
not
pleased
to
find
a
partiallydressed
Daario
exiting
Daario
quips
that
it
is
a
good
time
to
petition
Daenerys
because
she
is
in
a
very
good
mood
Entering
the
queens
conference
room
he
expresses
his
distrust
for
Daario
insinuating
that
Daario
only
murdered
his
superiors
and
joined
forces
with
Daenerys
out
of
lust
and
thus
is
not
a
trustworthy
ally
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
she
sent
Daario
to
take
the
Second
Sons
to
Yunkai
to
regain
control
over
the
city
and
kill
the
masters
that
have
resurfaced
Jorah
relates
to
the
mercy
shown
by
Eddard
Stark
for
his
dealings
in
slavery
and
convinces
Daenerys
to
bring
the
masters
to
justice
without
execution
Daenerys
considers
for
a
moment
and
then
tells
Jorah
to
assign
Hizdahr
zo
Loraq
as
her
ambassador
to
offer
the
masters
a
choice
they
can
live
free
in
the
new
world
she
wants
to
create
or
they
can
die
clinging
to
their
old
one
The
Second
Sons
will
be
stationed
in
Yunkai
to
enforce
whichever
choice
the
masters
make
She
also
says
to
let
Daario
know
that
it
was
Jorah
who
changed
her
mind
Daenerys
banishes
Ser
Jorah
from
her
service
As
Barristan
Selmy
watches
the
Unsullied
taking
down
the
crucified
slave
masters
outside
of
Meereen
a
small
boy
approaches
him
giving
him
a
scroll
bearing
the
seal
of
the
kings
hand
As
Barristan
reads
it
he
realizes
that
the
letter
was
signed
by
Robert
Baratheon
the
same
year
Jorah
and
Daenerys
first
met
each
other
Barristan
confronts
Jorah
about
this
before
telling
Daenerys
saying
that
he
doesnt
want
to
go
behind
Jorahs
back
He
tells
Jorah
that
he
knows
the
truth
Jorah
was
intially
working
as
a
spy
for
Robert
As
Jorah
asks
to
speak
with
Daenerys
alone
Barristan
tells
him
you
will
never
be
alone
with
her
again
In
the
throne
room
as
Jorah
walks
up
the
steps
towards
Daenerys
the
tension
mounts
when
she
asks
for
an
explanation
Jorah
explains
that
the
situation
is
a
ploy
by
TywinLannister
in
order
to
divide
them
However
as
the
scroll
was
signed
the
year
Jorah
first
met
Daenerys
she
asks
if
the
pardon
was
forged
Reluctantly
Jorah
tells
the
truth
at
Daeneryss
request
He
confesses
to
providing
the
spider
the
information
on
Daeneryss
activities
in
Essos
Ser
Jorah
leaves
Meereen
Daenerys
gets
angry
when
Jorah
also
admits
that
he
provided
the
information
of
her
pregnancy
with
Drogos
child
as
it
led
to
her
nearly
getting
poisoned
by
the
wine
merchant
outside
of
VaesDothrak
Jorah
defensively
tells
her
that
if
it
hadnt
been
for
him
she
would
have
been
poisoned
but
she
counters
that
was
only
because
he
saw
it
coming
Jorah
calls
her
name
and
begs
for
her
forgiveness
but
she
rejects
saying
that
he
sold
all
her
secrets
to
Robert
the
man
whom
she
finds
guilty
of
her
familys
murder
Jorah
is
forced
to
leave
the
city
within
the
day
or
have
his
head
thrown
into
the
Slavers
Bay
Jorah
then
leaves
Meereen
Season
Ser
Jorah
kidnaps
Tyrion
intending
to
take
him
to
Daenerys
Jorah
resurfaces
in
Volantis
drinking
in
a
brothel
and
shamefully
eyeing
a
whore
dressed
as
Daenerys
From
afar
he
recognizes
Tyrion
Lannister
and
Varys
Jorah
later
approaches
Tyrion
while
he
is
urinating
alone
and
binds
him
with
rope
and
gags
him
telling
Tyrion
that
he
is
taking
him
to
the
Queen
With
Tyrion
captive
Jorah
steals
a
small
boat
and
begins
to
sail
east
towards
Meereen
En
route
Tyrion
pesters
Jorah
with
muffled
whining
until
he
relents
and
removes
Tyrions
gag
Tyrion
notices
that
they
are
traveling
east
and
not
west
towards
Cersei
in
Kings
Landing
Jorah
reveals
that
he
is
taking
Tyrion
to
the
queen
he
serves
Daenerys
Targaryen
Tyrion
is
pleasantly
surprised
and
tries
to
convince
him
that
they
are
on
the
same
side
since
he
was
traveling
to
meet
Daenerys
anyway
He
also
accurately
deduces
who
Jorah
is
by
his
appearance
and
equipment
He
also
correctly
assumes
that
Jorah
must
have
been
banished
by
Daenerys
because
she
discovered
that
he
was
spying
on
her
for
Varys
Tyrion
mockingly
asks
Jorah
if
he
really
believes
that
he
will
earn
a
pardon
for
simply
delivering
him
to
Daenerys
alternately
she
might
pardon
Tyrion
and
behead
Jorah
instead
Fed
up
with
his
captive
Jorah
knocks
Tyrion
across
the
face
leaving
him
unconscious
Ser
Jorah
notices
that
his
wrist
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
As
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
their
journey
Tyrion
continues
to
mock
House
Mormont
as
well
as
Bear
Island
Eventually
the
two
find
Old
Valyria
and
passes
through
its
ruins
to
find
Meereen
While
sailing
through
the
ruins
the
two
look
in
astonishment
as
they
see
Drogon
fly
past
them
In
a
quick
turn
of
events
men
infected
with
Greyscale
appear
and
attack
the
two
Jorah
manages
to
fight
them
off
but
Tyrion
is
pulled
underwater
When
Tyrion
wakes
up
he
finds
himself
on
shore
saved
by
Jorah
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
but
Jorah
looks
at
his
wrists
and
notices
he
has
been
infected
with
Greyscale
Jorah
and
Tyrion
continue
towards
Meereen
on
foot
having
failed
to
acquire
a
boat
During
conversation
Tyrion
mentions
to
Jorah
that
he
knew
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
from
his
trip
to
the
Wall
and
reveals
that
he
was
killed
by
his
own
men
in
a
mutiny
while
returning
from
a
great
ranging
leaving
Jorah
visibly
saddened
at
his
fathers
death
Jorah
is
also
pressed
by
Tyrion
for
information
as
to
why
he
is
serving
Daenerys
in
the
first
place
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
captured
by
slavers
Jorah
tells
him
that
he
grew
to
truly
believe
in
her
when
he
saw
her
emerge
from
Khal
Drogos
funeral
pyre
unscathed
with
three
dragon
hatchlings
and
that
she
also
has
a
birthright
to
the
throne
even
though
Tyrion
mentions
the
infamous
Targaryen
madness
that
may
surface
in
her
later
in
life
However
they
are
found
and
captured
by
slavers
The
leader
Malko
plans
to
sell
them
in
Volantis
but
Tyrion
convinces
them
to
allow
Jorah
to
participate
in
the
fighting
pits
in
Meereen
to
make
them
rich
offering
the
information
that
Jorah
once
unseated
Jaime
Lannister
in
a
jousting
match
When
Malko
scoffs
this
Jorah
brings
up
that
he
slew
Qotho
in
single
combat
inciting
Malkos
interest
and
convincing
him
to
take
them
to
Meereen
On
the
outskirts
of
Meereen
Jorah
is
put
on
auction
by
Malko
who
exaggerates
Jorahs
accomplishments
by
claiming
that
along
with
fighting
alongside
The
Stag
King
he
took
part
in
the
attack
on
Spike
with
his
flaming
sword
when
it
was
really
Thoros
of
Myr
singlehandedly
killed
Khal
Drogo
and
was
betrayed
by
his
wife
and
willingly
sold
into
slavery
in
order
to
repay
his
debts
A
slaver
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
buys
Jorah
and
Tyrion
as
well
when
Tyrion
convinces
him
They
are
taken
to
one
of
the
fighting
pits
and
when
Jorah
learns
that
Daenerys
is
present
for
the
opening
of
the
games
he
takes
a
sword
and
enters
the
arena
knocking
out
the
other
fighters
while
disguised
with
a
helmet
Jorah
approaches
Daenerys
and
removes
his
helmet
to
reveal
his
identity
but
Daenerys
who
still
hasnt
forgiven
him
orders
Jorah
to
be
taken
away
Jorah
informs
her
that
he
has
brought
a
gift
and
Tyrion
reveals
himself
meeting
Daenerys
facetoface
at
last
Ser
Jorah
and
Tyrion
are
brought
before
Daenerys
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Back
in
Meereen
Daenerys
after
learning
Tyrion
wants
to
advise
her
asks
him
what
he
thinks
she
should
do
with
Jorah
Tyrion
tells
her
how
devoted
Jorah
seemed
to
be
to
her
and
that
he
did
not
think
she
would
be
wise
enough
to
forgive
him
He
then
tells
her
how
killing
people
devoted
to
her
is
not
a
ruler
who
inspires
devotion
and
that
she
would
need
lots
of
it
if
she
was
ever
going
to
rule
Westeros
but
when
she
did
he
couldnt
be
by
her
side
Daenerys
then
orders
Jorah
removed
from
the
city
once
more
Jorah
with
his
Greyscale
slowly
progressing
returns
to
the
fighting
pits
where
Yezzan
zo
Qaggaz
remains
Since
he
won
the
earlier
match
Jorah
demanded
that
he
fight
at
the
great
pit
in
front
of
the
queen
Jorah
says
he
is
the
best
he
has
and
that
if
he
wins
he
will
belong
to
Yezzan
Jorah
later
joins
the
Great
Games
in
Daznaks
Pit
in
front
of
the
queen
along
with
a
Water
Dancer
from
Braavos
a
Dothraki
warrior
a
Summer
Islander
with
a
halberd
a
Meereenese
champion
wielding
a
spear
and
another
fighter
When
Daenerys
recognizes
Jorah
she
is
visibly
distraught
and
as
the
fighting
continues
and
Jorah
is
severely
wounded
by
the
water
dancer
Tyrion
reminds
Daenerys
that
she
could
stop
the
fight
at
any
moment
to
save
Jorah
Ser
Jorah
fighting
in
the
Great
Pit
of
Daznak
Even
though
the
fear
is
clearly
shown
on
her
face
Daenerys
refuses
Jorah
manages
to
win
the
fight
despite
being
outmatched
during
most
of
it
Just
as
the
fight
ends
Jorah
throws
a
spear
towards
Daenerys
who
believing
the
spear
was
meant
for
her
ducks
out
of
the
way
The
spear
is
revealed
to
be
meant
for
a
Son
of
the
Harpy
who
was
sneaking
up
behind
her
Much
of
the
audience
reveals
themselves
to
be
Sons
of
the
Harpy
proceeding
to
kill
everyone
they
can
Jorah
joins
the
ensuing
battle
for
Daenerys
and
tries
to
help
escort
her
out
of
the
fighting
pit
but
they
eventually
end
up
surrounded
and
vastly
outnumbered
At
that
moment
Drogon
appears
in
the
arena
and
starts
killing
the
Sons
of
the
Harpy
and
scaring
off
the
rest
Jorah
Tyrion
Daario
and
Missandei
all
observe
in
awe
as
Daenerys
flies
off
on
Drogon
Back
in
the
Great
Pyramid
Tyrion
addresses
both
Jorah
and
Daarios
feelings
for
Daenerys
understanding
how
one
could
love
the
wrong
woman
The
three
argue
about
Jorahs
betrayal
but
they
will
not
make
any
judgments
without
Daenerys
first
Jorah
Tyrion
and
Daario
plan
their
next
move
The
dragon
was
seen
taking
her
north
and
it
is
agreed
that
Jorah
will
join
Daario
to
ride
and
search
for
her
Grey
Worm
still
recovering
from
his
injuries
offers
to
go
with
them
as
does
Tyrion
Daario
firmly
nixes
both
ideas
Grey
Worm
is
needed
to
command
the
Unsullied
in
keeping
the
city
under
control
while
Tyrion
is
the
only
one
of
them
to
have
any
political
experience
Thus
Daario
and
Jorah
depart
together
hoping
to
find
their
Queen
in
the
Dothraki
Sea
Season
Jorah
and
Daario
search
for
Dany
Jorah
and
Daario
follow
Drogons
trail
into
the
Dothraki
sea
where
Daario
gets
him
to
admit
he
is
in
love
with
Daenerys
While
Daario
isnt
looking
Jorah
examines
the
spreading
greyscale
on
his
arm
to
determine
how
long
he
has
left
to
live
They
eventually
discover
a
circle
of
hoof
prints
where
Jorah
finds
Daeneryss
ring
in
the
middle
leading
them
to
realize
a
Dothraki
khalasar
has
taken
her
captive
Jorah
and
Daario
make
their
way
to
Vaes
Dothrak
with
Daario
taunting
Jorah
about
how
Daenerys
chose
him
as
her
lover
Jorah
scans
the
city
and
deduces
that
Daenerys
has
been
taken
to
the
temple
of
the
dosh
khaleen
Jorah
and
Daario
leave
their
weapons
outside
the
city
and
Daario
notices
Jorahs
greyscale
Jorah
assures
Daario
that
he
was
not
infected
The
two
sneak
into
the
city
at
night
and
are
caught
by
two
Dothraki
Jorah
tries
to
pass
off
himself
and
Daario
as
lost
merchants
but
the
Dothraki
see
through
the
ruse
After
killing
them
Jorah
and
Daario
find
Daenerys
and
offer
to
help
her
escape
the
city
but
she
enlists
them
in
her
plan
to
take
control
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
and
Daario
kill
the
guards
outside
the
temple
in
which
the
khals
are
determining
Daeneryss
fate
and
bar
the
door
resulting
in
the
khals
being
unable
to
escape
when
Daenerys
sets
the
temple
ablaze
When
Daenerys
emerges
from
the
inferno
unburnt
Jorah
and
Daario
bow
before
her
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Dothraki
Jorah
shows
Daenerys
his
greyscale
sickness
The
next
day
overlooking
the
smoldering
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
the
Dosh
Khaleen
Daenerys
confronts
Jorah
She
reminds
him
that
she
has
banished
him
twice
but
remembers
that
he
has
twice
returned
and
has
saved
her
life
As
she
ponders
what
to
do
Jorah
interjects
that
she
must
send
him
away
revealing
his
greyscale
He
explains
that
he
does
not
know
of
a
cure
or
how
long
the
disease
takes
but
that
he
will
end
things
before
he
becomes
a
stone
man
himself
Jorah
then
tells
Daenerys
that
Tyrion
Lannister
was
right
about
him
he
loves
her
and
will
always
love
her
and
begins
to
leave
Daenerys
stops
him
and
rather
than
dismissing
him
tearfully
orders
Jorah
to
go
and
find
a
cure
for
his
disease
so
that
he
may
be
by
her
side
when
she
takes
back
the
Seven
Kingdoms
Jorah
and
Dany
then
part
on
good
terms
as
he
watches
her
lead
her
new
khalasar
out
of
Vaes
Dothrak
before
embarking
on
his
own
new
quest
Season
Sam
performs
a
risky
treatment
on
Jorah
to
cure
him
of
his
greyscale
Jorah
has
traveled
to
Oldtown
seeking
a
cure
for
his
greyscale
but
has
been
placed
inside
one
of
the
sick
cells
in
the
Citadel
As
Samwell
Tarly
is
collecting
empty
bowls
from
cells
Jorah
reaches
out
for
him
his
infection
having
spread
rapidly
and
asks
if
Daenerys
has
reached
Westeros
yet
but
Sam
claims
he
does
not
know
Jorah
is
later
deemed
beyond
saving
by
Archmaester
Ebrose
and
is
told
that
he
has
one
more
day
before
he
will
be
deported
to
the
Valyrian
Peninsula
to
live
out
the
rest
of
his
days
with
the
stone
men
as
the
greyscale
will
take
over
his
mind
in
six
months
Within
that
time
he
still
seeks
to
end
his
own
life
before
then
He
properly
introduces
himself
to
Samwell
explaining
that
there
is
no
point
writing
to
Lyanna
Mormont
as
House
Mormont
forgot
about
him
a
long
time
ago
Jorah
returns
to
Dany
Later
that
night
as
Jorah
writes
a
farewell
note
to
Daenerys
he
is
visited
by
Sam
who
claims
that
out
of
respect
for
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
he
will
try
to
save
him
from
his
greyscale
though
he
admits
he
has
never
tried
before
and
is
the
only
one
who
will
despite
it
being
risky
for
both
Sam
and
Jorah
Aware
of
the
alternative
Jorah
consents
to
the
treatment
He
is
given
rum
as
anesthesia
and
a
mouthguard
to
bite
on
during
the
painful
procedure
to
stay
silent
Bearing
the
pain
Jorah
allows
Sam
to
start
peeling
his
infected
skin
away
With
his
greyscale
now
cured
by
Samwell
Ebrose
allows
the
release
of
Jorah
from
his
cell
When
Ebrose
asks
of
the
disease
Jorah
says
it
must
have
cured
itself
from
having
plenty
of
rest
Before
Jorah
leaves
he
tells
Sam
he
will
return
to
Daenerys
that
both
she
and
Sam
has
saved
his
life
Jorah
shakes
Sams
hand
in
gratitude
before
leaving
After
leaving
the
Citadel
Jorah
makes
his
way
to
Dragonstone
where
he
is
finally
reunited
with
Daenerys
who
gladly
accepts
him
back
into
her
service
and
calls
him
a
friend
He
also
meets
Jon
Snow
who
served
under
his
father
Jeor
Mormont
in
the
Nights
Watch
Jorah
later
attends
a
meeting
during
which
Tyrion
Lannister
suggests
that
they
should
capture
a
wight
and
bring
it
to
Cersei
Lannister
thus
proving
that
the
army
of
the
dead
is
marching
upon
Westeros
and
allowing
Daenerys
to
take
her
troops
to
help
Jon
Jorah
volunteers
to
join
the
mission
and
leaves
Dragonstone
with
Jon
Davos
Seaworth
and
Gendry
Upon
arriving
at
EastwatchbytheSea
Jorah
quickly
recognizes
the
imprisoned
Thoros
of
Myr
having
fought
together
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
Unfortunately
the
mention
of
Jorahs
family
name
creates
friction
with
Tormund
due
to
Jeor
Mormonts
role
in
persecuting
the
wildlings
Nevertheless
Jorah
accompanies
the
party
north
of
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Jon
to
keep
Longclaw
Once
beyond
the
Wall
Jorah
discusses
his
fathers
death
with
Jon
Snow
stating
that
being
killed
by
his
own
men
was
the
worst
way
for
Jeor
to
pass
away
They
also
discuss
the
fact
that
Ned
Stark
wanted
to
execute
Jorah
and
Jon
offers
to
give
Longclaw
back
to
House
Mormont
However
Jorah
refuses
as
he
brought
shame
on
his
family
he
has
no
longer
the
right
to
wield
the
weapon
which
must
remain
with
Jon
as
Jeor
wanted
Later
the
party
is
attacked
by
an
undead
bear
which
severely
injures
Thoros
before
Jorah
kills
the
beast
with
a
final
strike
Jorah
and
Thoros
then
discuss
the
Siege
of
Pyke
with
Thoros
acknowledging
that
he
was
so
drunk
that
day
that
he
completely
forgot
the
battle
Jorah
assists
in
subduing
a
wight
The
party
finally
encounters
a
small
group
of
wights
led
by
a
White
Walker
They
attack
it
and
Jorah
is
assaulted
by
a
wight
who
tries
to
choke
him
to
death
before
being
shattered
when
Jon
kills
the
White
Walker
leading
them
They
successfully
capture
an
undead
but
it
draw
the
attention
of
the
whole
undead
army
which
rushed
at
them
While
Gendry
returns
to
Eastwatch
to
send
a
raven
to
Daenerys
Jorah
and
the
others
find
refuge
on
a
small
island
in
the
middle
of
the
frozen
lake
that
the
wights
cannot
cross
They
spend
the
night
on
the
rocks
to
which
Thoros
does
not
survive
and
are
later
attacked
by
the
army
of
the
Night
King
as
the
ice
layer
over
the
water
is
solid
enough
Jorah
fights
along
the
others
with
a
pair
of
dragonglass
daggers
destroying
many
wights
but
the
party
is
easily
outnumbered
and
only
survives
thanks
to
the
arrival
of
Daenerys
and
her
dragons
Jorah
is
shocked
and
saddened
when
he
witnesses
the
death
of
Daenerys
youngest
dragon
Viserion
at
the
hands
of
the
Night
King
The
survivors
manage
to
escape
except
Jon
Snow
who
is
taken
beneath
the
lake
by
wights
Back
to
the
Wall
Jorah
tells
Daenerys
that
they
should
return
to
Kings
Landing
and
attends
Jons
return
to
Eastwatch
after
he
was
saved
by
Benjen
Stark
Jorah
during
the
negotiation
in
the
Dragonpit
Jorah
goes
to
Kings
Landing
to
attend
the
negotiation
between
Daenerys
Cersei
and
Jon
explaining
the
origins
of
the
Dragonpit
to
Missandei
on
the
way
They
are
greeted
by
Bronn
who
escorts
them
to
their
seats
with
Jorah
sitting
right
next
to
Daenerys
Jorah
does
not
speak
during
the
discussions
Like
everyone
else
he
is
surprised
when
Jon
openly
pledges
allegiance
to
Daenerys
and
stays
at
the
Dragonpit
while
Tyrion
tries
to
convince
Cersei
to
help
them
after
she
left
the
negotiation
After
Cersei
seemingly
agrees
to
send
troops
to
fight
the
army
of
the
Night
King
Jorah
leaves
Kings
Landing
with
the
others
and
make
his
way
to
the
North
Personality
Jorah
is
a
complex
character
as
he
isDaenerys
Targaryens
most
loyal
advisor
and
a
formidable
warrior
Jorah
has
a
deep
respect
loyalty
and
love
for
Daenerys
and
has
always
tried
to
give
her
reasonable
practical
and
effective
advice
While
Jorah
is
a
moral
person
and
always
tries
to
be
honorable
he
has
done
several
dishonorable
acts
out
of
love
or
for
his
own
survival
He
sold
poachers
into
slavery
to
pay
for
his
wifes
spending
habits
fled
Westeros
to
escape
executionand
briefly
spied
on
Daenerys
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
royal
pardon
though
he
stopped
spying
on
her
after
becoming
her
advisor
Jorah
is
Daeneryss
most
levelheaded
advisor
at
least
until
the
arrival
of
Barristan
Selmy
Jorah
is
intelligent
literate
and
well
travelled
knowing
the
histories
of
Essos
and
speaking
several
tongues
including
Dothraki
His
relationship
with
his
father
and
likely
the
rest
of
his
family
wasnt
approached
until
the
fifth
season
Although
he
never
showed
any
feelings
towards
Jeor
once
he
was
given
the
news
about
his
death
Jorah
was
visibly
shaken
and
deeply
upset
even
angrily
demanding
to
know
the
details
of
his
fathers
death
This
is
most
likely
because
he
was
still
feeling
guilty
about
bringing
his
family
shame
and
never
fully
reconciling
with
Jeor
Although
stoic
shortspoken
and
sometimes
cold
Jorah
does
have
the
ability
to
warm
up
to
people
once
they
earn
his
respect
At
first
he
treated
Tyrion
like
a
hostage
but
later
after
the
two
barely
survived
the
sinking
of
their
boat
he
started
to
trust
Tyrion
enough
to
leave
him
untied
and
later
the
two
men
shared
their
life
stories
and
freely
discussed
Daenerys
and
her
claim
to
the
throne
although
their
newfound
trust
was
shattered
when
Tyrion
convinced
Daenerys
to
exile
Jorah
from
Meereen
again
which
he
did
to
spare
him
Daeneryss
wrath
He
is
also
a
skilled
warrior
though
he
does
have
a
honor
code
and
tries
not
to
kill
his
opponent
if
such
option
is
possible
This
is
shown
in
the
fighting
pit
where
every
other
warrior
was
brutally
slaughtering
one
another
but
Jorah
came
victorious
without
any
loss
of
life
in
his
hands
This
worked
in
his
favor
since
he
was
aware
that
Daenerys
was
becoming
increasingly
appalled
by
the
needless
violence
happening
in
the
pit
right
before
Jorah
got
into
the
skirmish
And
even
after
using
brute
force
to
harm
another
person
he
does
seem
to
try
compensate
for
his
actions
as
he
did
give
some
money
to
a
knocked
out
fisherman
for
his
stolen
boat
Also
Jorah
has
an
immense
tolerance
for
pain
as
he
managed
to
stay
silent
during
Sams
procedure
to
cure
him
of
the
greyscale
even
though
the
Citadel
apprentice
was
effectively
cutting
bits
of
Jorahs
own
skin

his
own
past
and
family
He
also
narrates
Vaes
Dothrak
and
The
Dothraki
on
the
Season
Bluray
In
the
books
In
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
novels
Jorah
is
described
as
balding
and
hairy
but
still
fit
though
not
a
handsome
man
He
is
the
son
of
Lord
Jeor
Mormont
of
Bear
Island
He
won
honor
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
when
he
was
one
of
the
first
through
the
breach
during
the
storming
of
Pyke
For
his
valor
he
won
praise
from
King
Robert
Baratheon
and
a
knighthood
With
a
strong
vigorous
son
ready
to
take
over
the
lordship
Jeor
decided
to
join
the
Nights
Watch
where
he
rapidly
rose
to
the
rank
of
Lord
Commander
leaving
Jorah
as
Lord
of
Bear
Island
Jorahs
first
wife
was
an
unnamed
woman
of
House
Glover
who
was
unable
to
carry
a
child
to
term
in
ten
years
of
marriage
and
died
after
a
third
miscarriage
She
has
not
been
referred
to
in
the
TV
series
He
later
married
Lynesse
Hightower
of
the
extremely
powerful
House
Hightower
of
Oldtown
after
winning
a
tournament
to
celebrate
the
victory
of
King
Robert
against
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion
in
which
Jorah
wore
Lynesses
favor
Lynesse
was
used
to
the
riches
and
luxury
of
the
secondlargest
city
in
Westeros
and
found
Bear
Island
primitive
and
crude
Jorahs
attempts
to
please
his
wife
led
to
him
spending
all
of
his
money
He
disgraced
himself
through
behavior
unbefitting
a
lord
by
arresting
poachers
and
selling
them
to
slavers
Slavery
is
illegal
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
has
been
for
millennia
When
Eddard
Stark
came
to
arrest
Jorah
he
and
Lynesse
fled
across
the
Narrow
Sea
to
the
Free
City
of
Lys
leaving
his
aunt
Maege
to
become
the
ruling
Lady
of
Bear
Island
Jorah
attempted
to
make
his
living
as
a
sellsword
but
was
unable
to
provide
an
income
acceptable
to
Lynesse
She
left
him
and
became
a
concubine
to
the
merchant
lord
Tregar
Ormollen
who
then
exiled
Jorah
from
the
city
Daenerys
learns
of
Jorahs
past
spying
for
Varys
earlier
in
the
book
narrative
before
she
conquers
Meereen
Ser
Barristan
initially
conceals
his
true
identity
from
her
claiming
to
be
a
squire
named
Arstan
Whitebeard
this
storyline
was
omitted
from
the
TV
series
and
when
he
finally
reveals
himself
he
also
tells
her
of
Jorahs
treachery
which
Barristan
knew
from
attending
Roberts
small
council
meetings
in
the
series
Barristan
was
not
a
member
of
the
small
council
and
thus
he
knew
nothing
of
Jorahs
spying
She
initially
dismisses
both
and
assigns
them
a
suicide
mission
to
conquer
Meereen
by
entering
the
city
via
its
sewers
To
her
surprise
and
disappointment
both
survive
the
mission
and
help
her
capture
the
city
She
forgives
Ser
Barristan
and
readmits
him
into
her
service
She
intends
to
pardon
Jorah
too
but
is
angered
by
his
attitude
he
remains
defensive
and
lacks
contrition
when
she
thinks
he
ought
to
be
begging
for
her
forgiveness
so
she
dismisses
him
although
she
fights
back
tears
as
she
does
so
Daenerys
tells
Jorah
that
if
she
sees
him
again
she
will
order
Strong
Belwas
who
does
not
appear
in
the
TV
series
to
wrench
his
head
off
Daario
Naharis
offers
to
kill
Jorah
for
her
but
Daenerys
decides
to
spare
him
and
he
is
allowed
to
leave
the
city
Daario
warns
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
kill
Jorah
or
otherwise
keep
him
close
There
is
no
mentioning
in
the
books
that
Jorah
ever
served
in
the
Golden
Company
though
it
is
said
that
after
Lynesse
left
him
he
scraped
by
as
a
sellsword
for
years
until
he
came
to
Pentos
to
spy
on
the
Targaryens
At
first
he
fought
as
a
sellsword
for
Lys
but
after
Lynesses
new
lover
exiled
him
from
the
city
he
drifted
to
Volantis
where
he
spent
the
better
part
of
a
year
working
as
a
sellsword
and
owning
nothing
but
his
sword
Jorah
is
never
attacked
by
Stone
Men
or
infected
with
Greyscale
Instead
Tyrion
was
attacked
by
Stone
Men
earlier
in
his
journeyin
the
ruins
of
Chroyane
instead
of
Valyria
It
is
a
man
named
Griff
one
of
Tyrions
companions
at
the
time
who
gets
infected
with
Greyscale
instead
Jorah
Tyrion
and
their
dwarf
companion
board
a
ship
at
Volantis
heading
for
Qarth
The
ship
is
badly
damaged
in
a
storm
After
drifting
for
at
least
nineteen
days
slavers
from
Yunkai
appear
Tyrion
and
all
the
rest
of
the
passangers
yield
without
fight
but
Jorah
resists
fiercely
and
kills
three
of
the
slavers
before
he
is
overcome
As
a
result
the
slavers
treat
him
much
more
harshly
than
their
other
captives
he
has
been
chained
to
an
oar
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
starved
and
branded
with
a
tattoo
of
demons
mask
on
one
cheek
His
face
has
been
so
bruised
and
swollen
that
he
is
almost
unrecognizable
Although
Jorah
has
treated
Tyrion
very
brutally
Tyrion
takes
no
pleasure
from
Jorahs
miseries
The
slavers
who
capture
Jorah
and
Tyrion
have
no
idea
who
Jorah
is
He
is
introduced
by
the
auctioneer
simply
as
big
and
strong
man
He
is
nearly
bought
by
Zahrina
for
the
fighting
pits
but
Tyrion
intervenes
and
persuades
the
overseer
of
Yezzans
slaves
to
buy
Jorah
too
claiming
that
he
takes
part
in
the
show
that
Tyrion
and
his
other
companion
play
for
entertainment
Jorah
does
not
try
to
escape
or
resist
his
captors
he
simply
ignores
their
commands
with
muttered
curses
so
he
is
locked
in
a
cage
and
beaten
severely
every
evening
to
the
point
that
he
hardly
looks
human
He
is
kept
naked
except
for
a
breechclout
a
filthy
bit
of
yellow
rag
He
never
gets
to
see
Daenerys
let
alone
speak
with
her
and
she
has
no
idea
he
is
nearby
Following
Daeneryss
departure
from
Meereen
Tyrion
and
Jorah
escape
from
Yezzan
to
the
camp
of
the
Second
Sons
who
betrayed
Daenerys
and
joined
the
Yunkai
Brown
Ben
Plumm
the
company
leader
is
astonished
to
see
Jorah
He
accepts
them
to
the
company
During
the
battle
between
Yunkai
and
the
defenders
of
Meereen
Jorah
tries
to
persuade
the
Second
Sons
to
switch
sides
He
promises
that
Find
her
hostages
Daario
Hero
and
Jhogo
and
free
them
And
I
will
swear
on
the
honor
of
my
house
and
home
that
this
was
Brown
Bens
plan
from
the
beginning
One
of
the
sellswords
says
that
it
is
for
Ben
Plumm
to
say
Shortly
afterwards
a
messenger
arrives
to
deliver
new
orders
Suddenly
herecognizes
Tyrion
as
an
escaped
slave
of
Yezzan
and
orders
surrender
him
Jorah
responds
by
killing
the
messenger
Jeor
Mormont
in
his
last
breath
told
Sam
Tarly
Tell
my
sonJorah
Tell
him
take
the
black
My
wish
Dying
wish
Tell
Jorah
Forgive
him
My
son
Please
So
far
in
the
novels
Jorah
has
not
been
informed
about
his
fathers
death
and
his
last
wish
According
